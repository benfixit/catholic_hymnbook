1. Come, sound his praise abroad,
And hymns of glory sing:
Jesus is the sovereign Lord,
The universal King.

_Chorus:_
_Praise ye the Lord, Alleluia!_
_Praise ye the Lord, Alleluia!_
_Alleluia, Alleluia, Alleluia!_
_Praise ye the Lord._

2. He formed the deeps unknown;
He gave the seas their bound;
The watery worlds are all his own,
And all the solid ground.

3. Come, worship at his throne,
Come, bow before the Lord:
We are his works, and not our own,
He formed us by His word.

4. To-day attend his voice,
Nor dare provoke his rod;
Come, as the people of his choice,
And own your gracious God.
