_Chorus:_
_On Christ, the solid rock, I stand;_
_All other ground is sinking sand,_
_All other ground is sinking sand._

1. My hope is built on nothing less
Than Jesus' blood and righteousness;
I dare not trust the sweetest frame,
But wholly lean on Jesus' name.

2. When darkness veils his lovely face,
I rest on his unchanging grace;
In ev'ry high and stormy gale,
My anchor holds within the veil.

3. His oath, his covenant, his blood
Support me in the whelming flood;
When all around my soul gives way,
He then is all my hope and stay.

4. When he shall come with trumpet sound,
Oh, may I then in him be found,
Dressed in his righteousness alone,
Faultless to stand before the throne.
