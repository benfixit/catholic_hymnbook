title: Jesus Keep Me Near the Cross
---

_Chorus:_
_In the cross, in the cross,_
_Be my glory ever;_
_Till my raptured soul shall find_
_Rest beyond the river._

1. Jesus, keep me near the cross,
There a precious fountain,
Free to all—a healing stream,
Flows from Calvary's mountain

2. Near the cross, a trembling soul,
Love and mercy found me;
There the Bright and Morning Star
Sheds its beams around me.

3. Near the cross! O Lamb of God,
Bring its scenes before me;
Help me walk from day to day,
With its shadow o'er me.

4. Near the cross I'll watch and wait,
Hoping, trusting ever,
Till I reach the golden strand,
Just beyond the river.
