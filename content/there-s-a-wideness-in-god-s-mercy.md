title: There's a Wideness in God's Mercy
---

1. There's a wideness in God's mercy
Like the wideness of the sea;
There's a kindness in his justice
Which is more than liberty.

2. There is no place where earth's sorrows
Are more felt than up in heav'n;
There is no place where earth's failings
Have such kindly judgement giv'n.

3. There is plentiful redemption
In the blood that has been shed;
There is joy for all the members
In the sorrows of the Head.

4. Souls of men! why will ye scatter
Like a crowd of frightened sheep?
Foolish hearts! why will ye wander
From a love so true and deep?

5. For the love of God is broader
Than the measures of man's mind,
And the heart of the Eternal
Is most wonderfully kind.
