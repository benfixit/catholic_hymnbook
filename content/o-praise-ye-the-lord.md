1. O praise ye the Lord! prepare a new song;
And let all his saints in full concert join:
With voices united the anthem prolong,
And show forth his praises with music divine.

2. Let praise to the Lord, who made us, ascend;
Let each grateful heart be glad in its King;
For God, whom we worship, our songs will attend,
and view with complacence the off'ring we bring.

3. Be joyful, ye saints, sustain'd by his might,
And let your glad songs awake with each morn:
For those who obey him are still his delight;
His hand with salvation the meek will adorn.

4. Then praise ye the Lord! prepare a glad song;
And let all his saints in full concert join;
With voices united the anthem prolong,
And shew forth his praises with music divine.
