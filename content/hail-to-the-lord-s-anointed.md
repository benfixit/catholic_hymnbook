title: Hail to the Lord's Anointed

---

1. Hail to the Lord's Anointed,
Great David's greater Son!
Hail, in the time appointed,
God's reign on earth begun!
Christ comes to break oppresion,
To set the captive free;
To take away transgression,
And rule in equity.

2. He shall come down like showers
Upon the fruitful earth,
And joy and hope, like flowers,
Spring in his path to birth:
Before him on the mountains
Shall peace, the herald, go;
And righteousness in fountains
From hill to valley flow.

3. Kings shall bow down before him,
And gold and incense bring;
All nations shall adore him,
His praise all peoples sing;
To him shall prayer unceasing
And daily vows ascend;
His kingdom still increasing,
A kingdom without end.

4. O'er ev'ry foe victorious,
He on his throne shall rest,
From age to age more glorious,
All blessing and all blest.
The tide of time shall never
His covenant remove;
His name shall stand forever,
That name to us is love.
