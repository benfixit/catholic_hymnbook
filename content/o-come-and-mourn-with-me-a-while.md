1. O come and mourn with me a while;
See Mary calls us to her side;
O come, together let us mourn:
Jesus, our Love, is crucified!

2. Have we no tears to shed for Him,
While soldiers scoff and foes deride?
Ah! Look how patiently He hangs:
Jesus, our Lord, is crucified!

3. How fast His feet and hands are nailed;
His blessed tongue with thirst is tied;
His failing eyes are blind with blood.
Jesus, our Love, is crucified.

4. Seven times He spake seven words of love;
And all three hours His silence cried
For mercy on the souls of men:
Jesus, our Lord, is crucified!

5. O break, O break, hard heart of mine:
Thy weak self-love and guilty pride
His Pilate and his Judas were:
Jesus, our Lord, is crucified!

6. A broken heart, a fount of tears,
Ask, and they will not be denied;
A broken heart love's cradle is,
Jesus, our love is crucified.

7. O love of God! O sin of man!
In this dread act your strength is tried;
And victory remains with love:
Jesus, our Lord, is crucified!
