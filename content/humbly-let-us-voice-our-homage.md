title: Humbly Let Us Voice Our Homage (Tantum Ergo)

---

1. Humbly let us voice our homage
For so great a sacrament:
Let all former rites surrender
To the Lord's New Testament;
What our senses fail to fathom
Let us grasp through faith's consent!

2. Glory, honour, adoration
Let us sing with one accord!
Praised be God, almighty Father;
Praised be Christ, His Son, our Lord;
Praised be God the Holy Spirit;
Triune Godhead be adored! Amen.
