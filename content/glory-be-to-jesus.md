1. Glory be to Jesus,
Who, in bitter pains,
Poured for me the life blood
From his sacred veins.

2. Grace and life eternal
In that blood I find;
Blest be his compassion,
Infinitely kind.

3. Blest through endless ages
Be thy precious stream,
Which from endless torment
Doth the world redeem.

4. Abel's blood for vengance
Pleaded to the skies;
But the blood of Jesus
For our pardon cries.

5. Oft as it is sprinkled
On our guilty hearts,
Satan in confusion
Terror-struck departs

6. Oft as earth exulting
Wafts in praise on high,
Hell with terror trembles,
Heav'n is filled with joy.

7. Lift ye then your voices;
Swell the mighty flood;
Louder still and louder
Praise the precious blood.
