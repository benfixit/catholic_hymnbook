_Chorus:_
_You do not want sacrifices and offering my Lord_
_You do not want sacrifices and offering my Lord_
_But You have prepared a body for me_
_Then I said, here I am_
_Then I said, here I am_
_To do your will O God_
_How I love to do Your will my God_
_I keep Your teaching (Your teaching) in my heart._

1. I heard the Lord say, whom shall I send?
Who will be my messenger?
I will go, go, send me my Lord, I will go.

2. I heard the Lord say, whom shall I send?
Who will be my messenger?

3. I heard the Lord say, whom shall I send?
Who will bring back Israel?

4. I heard the Lord say, whom shall I send?
Who will be our light to the nations?
