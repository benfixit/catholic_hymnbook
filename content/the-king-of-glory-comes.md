_Chorus:_
_The King of glory comes, the nation rejoices._
_Open the gates before him, lift up your voices._

1. Who is the King of glory, how shall we call him?
He is Emmanuel, the promised of ages.

2. In all of Galilee, in city or village,
He goes among his people curing their illness.

3. Sing then of David's Son, our Savior and brother;
In all of Galilee was never another.

4. He gave his life for us, the pledge of salvation,
He took up on himself the sins of the nation.

5. He conquered sin and death; he truly has risen.
And he will share with us his heavenly vision.
