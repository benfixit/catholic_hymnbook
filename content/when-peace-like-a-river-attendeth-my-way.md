title: When Peace Like A River Attendeth My Way
---

_Chorus:_
_It is well, it is well_
_With my soul, with my soul_
_It is well, it is well, with my soul._

1. When peace like a river attendeth my way
When sorrow, like sea billows roll
What ever my lot
Thou hast taught me to say
It is well, it is well, with my soul.

2. Though Satan should buffet
Tho' trials should come
Let this blest assurance control
That Christ hath regarded my helpless estate
It is well, it is well, with my soul.
