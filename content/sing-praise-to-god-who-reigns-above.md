title: Sing Praise to God Who Reigns Above

---

1. Sing praise to God who reigns above,
The God of all creation,
The God of pow'r, the God of love,
The God of our salvation;
With healing balm my soul he fills,
And ev'ry faithless murmur stills:
To God all praise and glory.

2. What God's almighty pow'r has made,
His gracious mercy keeping;
By morning glow or evening shade
His watchful eye ne'er sleeping;
Within the kingdom of his might,
Lo! all is just and all is right:
To God all praise and glory.

3. Then all my toilsome way along,
I sing aloud your praises,
That all may hear the grateful song
My voice unweared raises;
Be joyful in the Lord, my heart,
Both soul and body sing your part:
To God all praise and glory.

4. Let all who name Christ's holy name
Give God all praise and glory;
All you who own his pow'r proclaim
Aloud the wondrous story!
He reigns triumphant on his throne;
The Lord is God, and he alone:
To God all praise and glory.
