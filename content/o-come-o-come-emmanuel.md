title: O Come, O Come, Emmanuel

_Chorus:_
_Rejoice! Rejoice! Emmanuel_
_Shall come to you, O Israel._

1. O come, O come, Emmanuel,
And ransom captive Israel
That mourns in lonely exile here
Until the Son of God appear.

2. O come, O Wisdom from on high,
Who ordered all things mightily;
To us in the path of knowledge show
And teach us in its ways to go.

3. O Come, O come, great Lord of might,
Who to your tribes on Sinai's height
In ancient times did give the law
In cloud and majesty and awe.

4. O come, O Branch of Jesse's stem,
Unto your own and rescue them!
From depths of hell your people save,
And give them vict'ry o'er the grave.

5. O come, O Key of David, come
And open wide our heav'nly home.
Make safe for us the heav'nward road
And bar the way to death's abode.

6. O come, O Bright and Morning Star,
And bring us comfort from afar!
Dispel the shadows of the night
And turn our darkness into light.

7. O come, O King of nations, bind
In one the hearts of all mankind.
Bid all our sad divisions cease
And be yourself our King of Peace.
