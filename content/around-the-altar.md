_Refrain_
_Around the altar;_
_We sing and pray with one heart,_
_Around the altar come,_
_Around the altar, we celebrate our oneness,_
_Our joy is full in Christ._

1. Take His body, singing, praying altogether,
Take the body of Christ,
Take His body, singing, praying altogether.
Take and eat with joy.

2. Drink His blood, singing, praying altogether,
Drink the blood of Christ
Drink his blood, singing, praying altogether,
Take and drink with joy.

3. This meal that is given by Christ Jesus
Is real food indeed
Whoever shares it will never die
He has eternal life.

4. Help us, Jesus to fully understand
The meaning of the meal
That we may be always very grateful
For Your death for the world.
