_Chorus:_
_Sweet Heart of Jesus! we implore,_
_Oh, make us love thee more and more._

1. Sweet Heart of Jesus! fount of love and mercy,
Today we come thy blessing to implore;
Oh, touch our hearts, so cold and so ungrateful,
And make them, Lord, thine own for ever more.

2. Sweet Heart of Jesus! make us know and love thee,
Unfold to us the treasures of thy grace,
That so our hearts, from things of earth uplifted,
May long alone to gaze upon thy face.

3. Sweet Heart of Jesus! make us pure and gentle,
And teach us how to do thy blessed will,
To follow close the prints of thy dear footsteps,
And when we fall - Sweet Heart, oh love us still.

4. Sweet Heart of Jesus! bless all hearts that love thee,
And may thine own Heart ever blessed be.
Bless us dear lord, and bless the friends we cherish,
And keep us true to Mary and to thee.
