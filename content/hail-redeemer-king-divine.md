title: Hail Redeemer King Divine
---

1. Hail Redeemer, King divine,
Priest and Lamb, the throne is Thine;
King whose reign shall never cease,
Prince of everlasting peace!

_Chorus:_
_Angels, saints and nations sing:_
_"Praise be Jesus Christ our King;_
_Lord of life, earth, sky and sea,_
_King of love on Calvary."_


2. King, whose name creation thrills,
Rule our minds, our hearts, our wills;
Till in peace, each nation rings,
With Thy praises, King of kings.

3. King most holy, King of truth,
Guard the lowly, guide the youth;
Christ, O King of glory bright,
Be to us eternal light.

4. Shepherd-king, o'er mountains steep,
Homeward bring Your wandering sheep;
Shelter in one royal fold,
States and kingdoms, new and old.
