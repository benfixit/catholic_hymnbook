1. Great Saint Joseph, son of David,
Foster father of our Lord,
Spouse of Mary ever-Virgin,
Keeping o'er them watch and ward:
In the stable thou didst guard them
With a father's loving care;
Thou by God's command didst save them
From the cruel Herod's snare.

2. Three long days, in grief, in anguish,
With his Mother sweet and mild,
Mary Virgin, didst thou wander,
Seeking the beloved Child.
In the temple thou didst find him:
O what joy then filled thy heart!
In thy sorrows, in thy gladness,
Grant us, Joseph, to have part.

3. Clasped in Jesus' arms and Mary's,
When death gently came at last,
Thy pure spirit, sweetly sighing,
From its earthly dwelling passed.
Dear Saint Joseph, by that passing,
May our death be like to thine,
And with Jesus, Mary, Joseph,
May our souls for ever shine. Amen.
