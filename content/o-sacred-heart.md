1. O Sacred Heart,
Our home lies deep in thee;
On earth thou art an exile's rest,
In heav'n the glory of the blest,
O Sacred Heart.

2. O Sacred Heart,
Thou fount of contrite tears;
Where'er those living waters flow,
New life to sinners they bestow,
O Sacred Heart.

3. O Sacred Heart,
Bless our dear native land;
May all her sons in truth e'er stand,
With faith's bright banner still in hand,
O Sacred Heart.

4. O Sacred Heart,
Our trust is all in thee;
For though earth's night be dark and drear,
Thou breathest rest where thou art near,
O Sacred Heart.

5. O Sacred Heart,
When shades of death shall fall,
Receive us 'neath thy gentle care,
And save us from the tempter's snare,
O Sacred Heart.

6. O Sacred Heart,
Lead exiled children home,
Where we may ever rest near thee,
In peace and joy eternally,
O Sacred Heart.
