1. God our Father everlasting,
Please accept the gifts we offer;
Take our bread upon the altar,
And our wine that fills the chalice.

2. Thankful hearts and joyful voices
We approach Your holy altar.
Bearing gifts of Your creation,
We return what You have given.

3. To You Father; now we offer
With the host and with the chalice.
All we have and all our being
In this sacrifice most holy.
