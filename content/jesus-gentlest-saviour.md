1. Jesus, gentlest Savior!
God of might and power!
Thou Thyself art dwelling
In us at this hour.

2. Nature cannot hold Thee,
Heav'n is all too straight
For Thine endless glory,
And Thy royal state.

3. Yet the hearts of children
Hold what worlds cannot,
And the God of wonders
Loves the lowly spot.

4. Jesus, gentlest Savior!
Thou art in us now;
Fill us full of goodness
Till our hearts o'erflow.

5. Pray the prayer within us
That to Heav'n shall rise;
Sing the song that angels
Sing above the skies.

6. Multiply our graces
Chiefly love and fear,
And, dear Lord! the chiefest,
Grace to persevere.
