title: My Times are in Thy Hand

---

1. My times are in Thy hand;
My God, I wish them there;
My life, my friends, my soul I leave
Entirely to Thy care.

2. My times are in Thy hand,
Whatever they may be,
Pleasing or painful, dark or bright,
As best may seem to Thee.

3. My times are in Thy Hand;
Why should I doubt or fear?
A Father's hand will never cause
His child a needless tear.

4. My times are in Thy hand,
Jesus the crucified;
The Hands my cruel sins had pierced
Is now my guard and guide.

5. My times are in Thy hand;
I'll always trust in Thee;
And after death, at Thy right hand
I shall for ever be.
