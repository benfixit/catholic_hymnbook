title: O Breathe on Me, O Breath of God

---

1. O breathe on me, O Breath of God,
Fill me with life anew,
That I may love the things you love,
And do what you would do.

2. O breathe on me, O Breath of God,
Until my heart is pure;
Until my will is one with yours,
To do and to endure.

3. O breathe on me, O Breath of God,
So shall I never die,
But live with you the perfect Life
For all eternity.
