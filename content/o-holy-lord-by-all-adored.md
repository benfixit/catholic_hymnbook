title: O Holy Lord By All Adored

1. O Holy Lord, by all adored,
Our trespasses confessing,
To You this day Your children pray,
Our holy Faith professing!
Accept, O King, the gifts we bring,
Our songs of praise, the prayers we raise;
And grant us, Lord, Your blessing,

2. O God on high, be thanks and praise.
Who deigns our bonds to sever;
His care shall guide us all our days,
And harm shall reach us never.
On him we rest with faith assured,
Of all that live He is the Lord,
Forever and forever.
