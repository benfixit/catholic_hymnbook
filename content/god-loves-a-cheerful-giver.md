_Chorus:_
_God Loves a Cheerful Giver_
_Give it all you've got,_
_He loves to hear you laughing_
_When you're in an awkward spot._
_When the odds add up against you,_
_It's time to stop and sing,_
_"Praise God!"_
_To praise Him is a joyous thing._

1. Peter always made a fuss,
Peter was impetuous,
He knew hard times when he denied his Lord,
But hardly had he fallen
When he sat right up began again,
Christ named him His successor, as his reward.

2. Jonah was a gloomy sort,
He always had a sad report,
He ran from God, he ran and he set sail,
His journey's end was quiet abrupt,
A fish came by and swallowed him up,
He spent three dark and dreary days inside a whale.

3. Holy Job was richly blessed,
He lost it all but stood the test,
For Job was steadfast in his misery,
"God gives to me, he takes away,
Blessed be the name of God this day",
And he was doubly blessed for his fidelity.
