1. Jesus eternal truth sublime,
Through endless years the same,
Thou crown of those who through all time,
Confess Thy holy name.

2. Thy suppliant people through the prayers,
Of Thy blessed saint forgive,
For His dear sake Thy wrath forbear,
And bid our spirits live.

3. Again returns the sacred day,
With heavenly glory bright,
Which saw Him go upon His way,
Into the beams of light.
