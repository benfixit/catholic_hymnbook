1. Praise God! Praise God! Who in his grace,
Now comes to bless this holy place.
Hark, Cherubim and Seraphim!
With Angel-voices welcome him!
Hosannas raise! To God be praise!

2. O great Jehovah, God of Might,
Here too is now thy throne of light.
Here is our rest, our strength, our food;
Here is thy living flesh and blood.
Here is thy new Jerusalem.
