1. Now the day is over,
Night is drawing nigh,
Shadows of the evening
Steal across the sky.

2. Now the darkness gathers,
Stars begin to peep,
Birds, and beasts and flowers
Soon will be asleep.

3. Jesus, give the weary
Calm and sweet repose;
With Thy tenderest blessing
May mine eyelids close.

4. Grant to little children
Visions bright of Thee;
Guard the sailors tossing
On the deep, blue sea.

5. Comfort every sufferer,
Watching late in pain;
Those who plan some evil
From their sin restrain.
