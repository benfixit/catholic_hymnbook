title: Fill My House unto the Fullest

---

1. Fill my house unto the fullest,
Eat my bread and drink my wine.
The love I bear is held from no-one.
All I have and all I do, I give to you.

2. Take my time unto the fullest,
Find in me the trust you seek.
Take my hands to you outreaching.
All I have and all I do, I give to you.

3. Christ our Lord with love enormous
From the cross His lesson taught:
Love all men (each one) as I have loved you.
All I have and all I do, I give to you.

4. Join with me as one in Christ-love,
May our hearts all beat as one.
May we give ourselves completely.
All I have and all I do, I give to you.
