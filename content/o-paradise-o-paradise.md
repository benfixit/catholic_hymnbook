title: O Paradise! O Paradise!

_Chorus:_
_Where loyal hearts and true_
_Stand ever in the light._
_All rapture through and through,_
_In God's most holy sight?_

1. O paradise! O paradise!
Who doth not crave for rest?
Who would not seek the happy land
Where they that loved are blest.

2. O paradise! O paradise!
Wherefore doth death delay?
Bright death that is the welcome dawn
Of our eternal day.

3. O paradise! O paradise!
'Tis weary waiting here;
I long to be where Jesus is,
To feel, to see Him near.

4. O paradise! O paradise!
I want to sin no more,
I want to be as pure on earth
As on thy spotless shore.

5. O paradise! O paradise!
I feel 'twill not be long;
Patience: I almost think I hear
Faint fragments of thy song.
