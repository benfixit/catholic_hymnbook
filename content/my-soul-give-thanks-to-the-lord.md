title: My Soul Give Thanks To the Lord

---

_Chorus:_
_My soul, give thanks to the Lord,_
_and bless His holy name._

1. My soul, give thanks to the Lord,
All my being bless His holy name,
My soul give thanks to the Lord,
And never forget all His blessings.

2. It is He who forgives all your guilt,
Who heals every one of your ills,
Who redeems your life from the grave,
Who crowns you with love and compassion.
Who fills your life with good things,
Renewing your youth like an eagle's.

3. The Lord does deeds of justice,
Gives judgement for all who are oppressed.
He made known His ways to Moses
And His deeds to Israel's sons.

4. The Lord is compassion and love,
Slow to anger and rich in mercy.
His wrath will come to an end,
He will not be angry for ever,
He does not treat us according to our sins
Nor repay us according to our faults.

5. For as the heavens are high above the earth,
So strong is His love for those who fear Him.
As far as the East is from the West
So far does He remove our sins.

6. As a father has compassion on his sons,
The Lord has pity on those who fear Him.
For He knows of what we are made,
He remembers that we are dust.

7. As for man, his days are like grass,
He flowers like the flower of the field;
The wind blows and he is gone,
And his place never sees him again.

8. Give praise to Father Almighty,
To His Son, Jesus Christ, the Lord,
To the Spirit who dwells in our hearts,
Both now and forever. Amen.
