title: Bethlehem! of Noblest Cities

---

1. Bethlehem! of noblest cities
None can once with thee compare;
Thou alone the Lord from heaven
Didst for us incarnate bear.

2. Fairer than the sun at morning,
Was the star that told his birth;
To the lands their God announcing,
Seen in fleshly form of earth.

3. By its lambent beauty guided
See, the eastern kings appear;
See them bend, their gifts to offer,
Gifts of incense, gold, and myrrh.

4. Solemn things of mystic meaning!
Incense doth the God disclose,
Gold a royal Child proclaimeth,
Myrrh a future tomb foreshows.

5. Holy Jesus, in thy brightness
To the Gentle world displayed,
With the Father and the Spirit
Endless praise to thee be paid.
