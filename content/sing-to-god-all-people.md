1. Sing to God all people
serve him with joy,
Come before him singing,
He is our God.

2. His is our creator;
shepherd and Lord.
Throng his holy temple,
Grateful and glad.

3. Praise him, serve him, bless him
How good is God,
Kind and ever gentle,
Great is his love.

4. Glory to the Father,
Praise to the Son,
To the Holy Spirit
Glory and praise.
