title: Dear Angel, Ever at My Side

---

1. Dear angel, ever at my side,
How loving must thou be,
To leave thy home in heaven to guard
A sinful child like me!

2. For I have felt thee in my thoughts
Fighting with sin for me:
And when my heart loves God,
I know the sweetness is from thee.

3. And when dear spirit, I kneel down
Morning and night to prayer,
Something there is within my heart
Which tells me thou art there.

4. Yet! when I pray thou prayest too,
Thy prayer is all for me;
But when I sleep thou sleepest not,
But watchest patiently.

5. Then, for thy sake
More humble will I be;
But I am weak, and when I fall,
O, weary not for me.
