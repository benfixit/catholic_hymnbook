title: Great Indeed are your Works, O Lord

---

_Refrain:_
_Great indeed are Your works,O Lord_
_Now and evermore._
_Great indeed are Your works,O Lord_
_Now and evermore._

1. The universe night and day,
Tells of all Your wonders,
You are our light and our life,
We shall praise You always.

2. You are the path which we tread,
You will lead us onward,
From every corner of earth,
All the nations gather.

3. You lead them all by the hand,
Of Your heavenly kingdom,
Then at the end of all time,
You will come in glory.
