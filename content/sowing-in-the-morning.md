_Chorus:_
_Bringing in the sheaves, bringing in the sheaves,_
_We shall come rejoicing, bringing in the sheaves,_
_Bringing in the sheaves, bringing in the sheaves,_
_We shall come rejoicing, bringing in the sheaves._

1. Sowing in the morning, sowing seeds of kindness,
Sowing in the noontide and the dewy eve;
Waiting for the harvest, and the time of reaping,
We shall come rejoicing, bringing in the sheaves.

2. Sowing in the sunshine, sowing in the shadows,
Fearing neither clouds nor winter's chilling breeze;
By and by the harvest, and the labor ended,
We shall come rejoicing, bringing in the sheaves.
