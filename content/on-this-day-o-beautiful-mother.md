_Chorus:_
_On this day, O beautiful Mother,_
_On this day we give thee our love,_
_Near thee, Madonna, fondly we hover,_
_Trusting thy gentle care to prove._

1. On this day we ask to share,
Dearest Mother, thy sweet care;
Aid us ere our feet astray
Wander from thy guiding way.

2. Queen of angels, deign to hear
Humble children's tender prayer;
Young hearts gain, O Virgin pure,
Jesus' love for them assure.
