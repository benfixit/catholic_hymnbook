1. Lord, accept the gifts we offer
At this Eucharistic feast,
Bread and wine to be transformed now,
Through the action of thy priest,
Take us too, Lord, and transform us,
May thy grace in us increase.

2. May our souls be pure and spotless,
As the host of wheat so fine,
May all stain of sin be crushed out
Like the grape that forms the wine,
As we too become partakers
In this sacrifice of love.

3. Take our gifts, Almighty Father,
Living God, eternal true,
Which we give through Christ, our Savior,
Pleading here for us anew;
Grant salvation to us present
And our faith and love renew.
