1. In the bleak midwinter,
Frosty wind made moan,
Earth stood hard as iron,
Water like a stone;
Snow had fallen, snow on snow,
Snow on snow,
In the bleak mid winter,
Long ago.

2. Our God, heav'n cannot hold him,
Nor earth sustain;
Heav'n and earth shall flee away
When he comes to reign:
In the bleak midwinter
A stable place sufficed
The Lord God Incarnate,
Jesus Christ.

3. Enough for him, whom cherubim,
Worship night and day,
breastful of milk
And a mangerful of hay;
Enough for him, whom angels
Fall down before,
The ox and ass and camel
Which adore.

4. Angels and archangels
May have gathered there,
Cherubim and seraphim
Throngèd the air;
But this mother only,
In her maiden bliss,
Worshipped the beloved
With a kiss.

5. What can I give him,
Poor as I am?
If I were a shephered,
I would bring a lamb;
If I were a wise man,
I would do my part;
Yet what I can I give him -
Give my heart.
