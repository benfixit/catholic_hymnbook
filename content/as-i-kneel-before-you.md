category: entrance

1. As I kneel before you,
As I bow my head in prayer,
Take this day, make it yours
And fill me with your love.

_Chorus:_
_Ave Maria, gratia plena,_
_Dominus tecum, benedicta tu._

2. All I have I give you,
Every dream and wish are yours;
Mother of Christ, mother of mine,
Present them to my Lord.

3. As I kneel before you,
And I see your smiling face,
Every thought, every word
Is lost in your embrace.
