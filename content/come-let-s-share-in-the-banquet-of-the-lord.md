1. Come, let's share in the banquet of the Lord,
In the Blessed Sacrament.
Come, let's share in the supper of the Lord,
In the Blessed Sacrament.

_Chorus:_
_Eat the bread and drink the wine,_
_Flesh and blood of the Lord divine,_
_Share His life, it is yours and mine,_
_For we are one in His design._

2. Come, let's share in the passion of the Lord,
In the Blessed Sacrament.
Come, let's share the resurrection of the Lord,
In the Blessed Sacrament.

3. Come, let's share in the ascension of the Lord,
In the Blessed Sacrament.
Come, let's share our union with the Lord,
In the Blessed Sacrament.

4. Come, let's share in the life of the Lord,
In the Blessed Sacrament.
Come, let's share in the love of the Lord,
In the Blessed Sacrament.

5. Come, let's share in the banquet of the Lord,
In the Blessed Sacrament.
Come, let's share in the supper of the Lord,
In the Blessed Sacrament.
