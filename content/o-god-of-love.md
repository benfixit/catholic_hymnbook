1. O God of love, O King of peace,
Make wars throughout the world to cease;
The plans of sinful men restrain;
Give peace, O Lord, give peace again.

2. Remember, Lord, Your works of old,
The wonders that our fathers told;
Remember not sin's dark stain;
Give peace, O Lord, give peace again.

3. Where saints and angels dwell above,
All hearts are one in holy love;
May we to that high state attain:
Give peace, O Lord, give peace again!
