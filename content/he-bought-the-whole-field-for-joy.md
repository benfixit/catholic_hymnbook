title: He Bought the Whole Field for Joy

---

_Chorus:_
_He bought the whole field for joy,_
_He bought the whole field for sheer joy_
_A man found a treasure,_
_It was hidden in a field._
_He bought the whole field for joy._

1. Paul was a Hebrew
By birth,
He left his land
To inherit the earth.
He sowed God's Word,
And when the seed gave yield
In the hearts of a few,
He bought the whole field.

2. A rich young man
Searching for truth,
Who kept the commandments
The whole of his youth,
Was promised a Kingdom
If he gave away all,
But he didn't have the vision of Paul.
Who bought the whole field for joy.

3. Don't keep your treasure
In a room,
Where thief doth steal
Or moth consume.
All our gain, we count but loss,
We are rich in Christ
Who chose a Cross.

4. The Kingdom of heaven
We've found
Is so like a treasure
Hidden in the ground.
The ground is the people
Who long to be healed.
If you really want the treasure,
Love the whole field.
