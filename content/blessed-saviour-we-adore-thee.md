title: Blessed Saviour We Adore Thee
---

1. Blessèd Saviour, we adore thee;
We Thy love and grace proclaim,
Thou art mighty, Thou art holy,
Glorious is Thy matchless name.

_Chorus:_
_Glorious, Glorious,_
_Glorious is Thy Name O Lord_
_Glorious, Glorious,_
_Glorious is Thy Name O Lord._

2. Great Redeemer, Lord and Master,
Light of all eternal days,
Let the saints of every nation,
Sing Thy just and endless praise.

3. From the throne of heaven's glory
To the cross of sin and shame,
Thou didst come to die a ransom,
Guilty sinners to reclaim.

4. Come, O come immortal Saviour,
Come and take Thy royal Throne.
Come and reign, and reign forever;
Be the kingdom all thine own.
