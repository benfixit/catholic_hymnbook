title: Today He's Risen, Death No More
---

_Chorus:_
_Alleluia, Alleluia, Alleluia, Alleluia._

1. Today He's risen, death no more,
shall bind Him to the grave,
No more can hell or sin's foul pow'r
o'er Him dominion have,
He likened to our sinful form,
Once doom'd Himself to die,
That He by death might death o'ercome,
Its deadly sting destroy.

2. O death: where's now your moral sting,
Who triumphed over you,
Not triumphed for Himself alone,
But by His mighty power,
Taught us to triumph in our turn,
Nor dread your terrors more

3. I know that my Redeemer lives,
And reigns above the skies,
He will revive my dust again,
And bid my body rise,
Then clothed in my own glorious flesh,
I shall behold His face
That sweet hope in my bosom glows
And cheers my ling'ring days.
