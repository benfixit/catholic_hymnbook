_Chorus:_
_Let our light shine for all to see,_
_Serving both friend and enemy._
_Since He died for us, let us live for Him,_
_and be His disciples eternally._

1. The Church is where men are,
For there we find Christ;
He's hid-den be-hind ev'ry face we be-hold,
By say-ing we're Christians,
We must be on guard;
Because through our actions
the truth will unfold.

2. The Church is where Christ is,
And Christ dwells in men.
And folks ev'ry where are made by the Lord.
What we do to others,
we do unto Him,
By judging our neighbour,
we spell our reward.

3. The Church is where men are,
And we are the Church;
It is from the fruit one discovers the tree.
We are silent witnesses
living the Mass
By taking Him with us
where ever we be.
