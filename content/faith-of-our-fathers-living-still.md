title: Faith of our Fathers Living Still
---

1. Faith of our fathers, living still
In spite of dungeon, fire and sword,
O how our hearts beat high with joy
Whene'er we hear that glorious word!

_Chorus:_
_Faith of our fathers! Holy faith!_
_We will be true to Thee till death!_

2. Our fathers, chained in prisons dark,
Were still in heart and conscience free;
And sweet would be their children's fate,
If they, like them, could die for thee!

3. Faith of our fathers, Mary's prayers,
Shall win our country back to thee;
And through the truth that comes from God
Mankind shall indeed be free.

4. Faith of our fathers, we will love
Both friend and foe in all our strife,
And preach thee, too, as love knows how
By kindly words and virtuous life.
