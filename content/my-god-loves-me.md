1. My God loves me.
And all the wonders I see,
Are all small signs of the love,
My God has for me.

2. He calls my name
To him no one else is the same,
To him I'm not lost in the crowd,
To Him I'm me.

3. My God loves me
Because of this I can see
In spit of all my fault,
He still loves me.

4. My God loves me,
what a mystery
That God should share his love,
With a sinner like me.
