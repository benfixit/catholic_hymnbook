1. Be thou my vision, O Lord of my heart;
All else be nought to me, save that thou art.
Thou my best thought, by day or by night,
Waking or sleeping, thy presence my light.

2. Be thou my wisdom, and thou my true word;
I ever with thee and thou with me, Lord;
Thou my great Father, thine own may I be:
Thou in me dwelling, and I one with thee.

3. High King of heaven, when vict'ry is won.
May I reach heaven's joys, bright heaven's Sun!
Heart of my heart, what ever be fall,
Still be my vision, O Ruler of all.
