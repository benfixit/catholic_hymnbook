title: Hark! The Herald Angels Sing

---

_Chorus:_
_Hark! The herald angels sing,_
_"Glory to the new-born King!"_

1. Hark! The herald angels sing,
"Glory to the new-born King;
Peace on earth and mercy mild,
God and sinners reconciled!"
Joyful all ye nations, rise,
Join the triumph of the skies;
With th'angelic hosts proclaim,
"Christ is born in Bethlehem!"

2. Christ, by highest heav'n adored;
Christ, the everlasting Lord;
Late in time behold him come,
Offspring of a Virgin's womb.
Veiled in flesh the Godhead see;
Hail th'incarnate Deity;
Pleased as man with man to dwell;
Jesus, our Emmanuel!

3. Hail, the heav'n-born Prince of Peace!
Hail, the Sun of Righteousness!
Light and life to all he brings,
Ris'n with healing in his wings.
Mild he lays his glory by,
Born that man no more may die,
Born to raise the sons of earth,
Born to give them second birth!
