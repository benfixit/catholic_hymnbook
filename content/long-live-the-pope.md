title: Long Live the Pope!

---

1. Long live the Pope! His praises sound
Again and yet again:
His rule is over space and time;
His throne the hearts of men:
All hail! the Shepherd-King of Rome,
The theme of loving song:
Let all the earth his glory sing,
And heav'n the strain prolong.
Let all the earth his glory sing,
And heav'n the strain prolong.

2. Beleaguered by the foes of earth,
Beset by hosts of hell,
He guards the loyal flock of Christ,
A watchful sentinel:
And yet, amid the din and strife,
The clash of mace and sword,
He bears alone the shepherd staff
This champion of the Lord.
He bears alone the shepherd staff
This champion of the Lord.

3. His signet is the Fisherman's;
No scepter does he bear;
In meek and lowly majesty
He rules from Peter's Chair:
And yet from ev'ry tribe and tongue,
From ev'ry clime and zone,
Three hundred million voices sing
The glory of his throne.
Three hundred million voices sing
The glory of his throne.

4. Then raise the chant, with heart and voice,
In church and school and home:
"Long live the Shepherd of the flock!
Long live the Pope of Rome!"
Almighty Father, bless his work,
Protect him in his ways,
Receive his prayers, fulfil his hopes,
And grant him "length of days."
Receive his prayers, fulfil his hopes,
And grant him "length of days."
