title: Come to the Springs of Living Water
---

_Refrain:_
_Come to the springs of living water_
_Flowing from the heart of God._

1. Come from the distant valley
to the mountain of the Land
Come from the far-off islands to God
Nations arise
Cast the clouds of darkness from your eyes.

2. Come with your precious ointment
to the mountain of the Lord
Come with your humble offerings to God.
Come to him now.
Hasten to pay him your vows.

3. Come with guitars and cymbals
to the mountain of the Lord.
Come with your music singing to God.
Lift up your voice.
Ours is the God of Jacob, rejoice.
