title: Come, Thou Almighty King

1. Come, thou Almighty King,
Help us thy name to sing,
Help us to praise.
Father all glorious,
Wholly victorious,
Come, and rule over us,
Ancient of Days.

2. Come, thou Incarnate Word,
And make your message heard,
Our prayer attend;
Come and your people bless,
And give your word success;
And let your holiness,
to us descend.

3. Come, Holy Comforter,
Your sacred witness bear,
In this glad hour;
You who almighty art,
Enlighten every heart
From us do not depart,
Spirit of pow'r!

4. To You, great One in Three,
Eternal praises be,
Hence, ever more!
Your sovereign majesty
May we in glory see,
And to eternity
Love and adore!
