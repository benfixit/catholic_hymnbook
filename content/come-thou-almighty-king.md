1. Come, thou Almighty King,
Help us thy name to sing,
Help us to praise.
Father all glorious,
O'er all victorious,
Come, and reign over us,
Ancient of Days.

2. Come, thou Incarnate Word,
Who for us death endured,
Our prayer attend;
Come and thy people bless,
And give thy word success;
Fill us with righteousness,
Savior and friend.

3. Come, Holy Comforter,
Thy sacred witness bear
In this glad hour;
To us thy grace impart;
And rule in ev'ry heart!
Never from us depart,
Spirit of pow'r!

4. To thee, O Trinity,
Eternal praises be
Forever more!
Thy sov'reign majesty
May we in glory see,
And to eternity
Love and adore!
