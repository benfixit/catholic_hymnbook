title: Savior of the Nations, Come

---

1. Savior of the nations, come;
Virgin's Son, make here thy home.
Marvel now, both heav'n and earth,
That the Lord chose such a birth.

2. Not by human flesh and blood,
By the Spirit of our God
Was the Word of God made flesh,
Mary's offspring, pure and fresh.

3. Thou, the Father's only Son,
Hast o'er sin the vict'ry won.
Boundless shall thy kingdom be;
When shall we its glories see?

4. Brightly doth thy manger shine;
Glorious is its light divine.
Let not sin o'er-cloud this light;
Ever be our faith thus bright.
