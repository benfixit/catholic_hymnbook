1. Hail Virgin, dearest Mary!
Our lovely Queen of May!
O spotless, blessed Lady,
Our lovely Queen of May.
Thy children, humbly bending,
Surround thy shrine so dear;
With heart and voice ascending,
Sweet Mary, hear our prayer.

2. Behold earth's blossoms springing
In beauteous form and hue.
All nature gladly bringing
Her sweetest charms to you.
We'll gather fresh, bright flowers,
To bind our fair Queen's brow;
From gay and verdant bowers,
We hast to crown thee now.

3. Hail Virgin, dearest Mary!
Our lovely Queen of May!
O spotless, blessed Lady,
Our lovely Queen of May.
And now, our blessed Mother,
Smile on our festal day;
Accept our wreath of flowers,
And be our Queen of May.
