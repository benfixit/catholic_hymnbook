title: There Was A Man in Jericho called Zaccheus

---

_Chorus:_
_There was a man in Jericho called Zaccheus._
_There was a man in Jericho called Zaccheus._
_Now the Hebrews, they were tall,_
_But Zaccheus, he was small,_
_Yet the Lord loved Zaccheus,_
_Better than them all._

1. The Lord went walking one day through Jericho town,
And the people began to gather from miles around
But Zaccheus, he couldn't see,
So he climbed a sycamore tree,
And the Lord looked up and said:
"Zaccheus, come down."

2. The Lord said: "Zaccheus, I am dining with you today,
Zaccheus, come to your house,
Come, lead the way."
Then Zaccheus, he gave a cheer,
But the people began to sneer,
"This man is a sinner,
Does the Lord seek lodging here?"

3. Now Zaccheus was small of stature,
But he could show,
That a man who is stout of heart can grow and grow:
"If I have cheated young and old,
I restore the goods fourfold."
And salvation came that day to his whole household.
