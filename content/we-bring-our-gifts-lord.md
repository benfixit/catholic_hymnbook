_Chorus:_
_Kumbaya ya, kumbaya_
_Kumbaya ya, kumbaya_
_Kumbaya ya, kumbaya_
_O Lord, kumbaya_

1. We bring our gifts, Lord, bread and wine
We bring our gifts, Lord, bread and wine
We bring ourselves, Lord, heart and mind
O Lord, kumbaya.

2. Make us one, Lord, as you prayed
Make us one, Lord, as you prayed
Grant us peace, Lord, hear our prayer
O Lord, kumbaya.

3. Let us love, Lord, as you loved
Let us love, Lord, as you loved
In this banquet, Lord, we find strength
O Lord, kumbaya.
