1. Lift up your heads, ye mighty gates;
Behold the King of glory waits!
The King of kings is drawing near;
The Savior of the world is here.

2. O blest the land, the city blest,
Where Christ the ruler is confessed!
O happy hearts and happy homes
To whom this King of triumph comes!

3. Fling wide the portals of your heart;
Make it a temple, set apart
From earthly use for heav'n's employ,
Adorned with prayer and love and joy.

4. So come, my sov'reign; enter in!
Let new and nobler life begin;
Thy Holy Spirit guide us on,
Until the glorious crown be won.
