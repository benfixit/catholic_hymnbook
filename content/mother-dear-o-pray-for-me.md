_Chorus:_
_Mother dear, remember me,_
_And never cease thy care,_
_Till in heav'n eternally,_
_Thy love and bliss I share._

1. Mother dear, O pray for me!
Whilst far from heav'n and thee
I wander in a fragile bark
O'er life's tempestuous sea,
O Virgin Mother, from thy throne,
So bright in bless above,
Protect thy child and cheer my path
With thy sweet smile of love.

2. Mother dear, O pray for me!
Should pleasure's siren lay,
E'er tempt thy child to wander far
From Virtue's path away.
When thorns beset life's devious way,
And darkling waters flow,
Then, Mary, aid thy weeping child,
Thyself a mother show.

3. Mother dear, O pray for me!
When all looks bright and fair,
That I may all my danger see,
For surely then 'tis near.
A mother's pray'r how much we need
If prosp'rous be the ray
That paints with gold the flow'ry mead,
Which blossoms in our way.
