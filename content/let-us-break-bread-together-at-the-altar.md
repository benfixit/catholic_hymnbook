title: Let Us Break Bread Together At the Altar
---

1. Let us break bread together at the altar,
Break bread together we are one;
For when we are together Christ is with us,
Break bread together for we are one.

2. Let us drink wine together at the altar,
Drink wine together we are one;
For when we are together Christ is with us,
Drink wine together for we are one.

3. Let us offer together gifts at the altar
Offer together we are one;
For when we are together Christ is with us,
Offer together for we are one.

4. Let us join hands together at the altar,
Join hands together we are one;
For when we are together Christ is with us,
Join hands together for we are one.

5. Let us love one another at the altar,
Love one another we are one;
For when we are together Christ is with us,
Love one another for we are one.
