title: What Star Is This

---

1. What star is this, with beams so bright,
More lovely than the noon-day light?
'Tis sent to announce a newborn king,
Glad tidings of our God to bring.

2. 'Tis now fulfiled what God decreed,
"From Jacob shall a star proceed;"
And lo! the eastern sages stand
To read in heav'n the Lord's command.

3. O Jesus, while the star of grace
Impels us on to seek thy face,
Let not our slothful hearts refuse
The guidiance of thy light to use.

4. To God almighty, heav'nly Light;
To Christ, revealed in earthly night,
To God the Holy Spirit raise
An endless song of thankful praise!
