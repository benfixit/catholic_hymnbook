_Chorus:_
_Take our bread, we ask You,_
_Take our hearts, we love You,_
_Take our lives,_
_O Father; we are Yours, we are Yours._

1. Yours as we stand at the table You set,
Yours as we eat the bread, our hearts can't forget,
We are a signs of Your life with us yet.
We are Yours, we are Yours.

2. Your holy people standing washed in Your blood,
Spirit filled, yet hungry, we await Your food,
We are poor, but we've brought ourselves - the best we could:
We are Yours, we are Yours.
