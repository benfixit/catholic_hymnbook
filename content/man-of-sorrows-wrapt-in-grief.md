1. Man of sorrows wrapt in grief,
Bow Thine ear to our relief;
Thou for us the path hast trod,
Of the dreadful wrath of God;
Thou the cup of fire hast drained,
Till its light alone remained.
Lamb of love! we look to Thee:
Hear our mournful litany.

2. By the garden, fraught with woe,
Whither Thou full oft wouldst go;
By Thine agony of prayer,
In the desolation there;
By the dire and deep distress,
Of that mystery fathomless,
Lord, our tears in mercy see:
Hearken to our litany.

3. By the chalice brimming o'er,
With disgrace and torment sore;
By those lips which fain would pray,
That it might but pass away;
By the heart which drank it dry,
Lest a rebel race should die,
Be Thy pity, Lord, our plea:
Hear our solemn litany.

4. Man of sorrows! let Thy grief,
Purchase for us our relief;
Lord of mercy! bow Thine ear,
Slow to anger, swift to hear;
By the Cross's royal road,
Lead us to the throne of God.
There for aye to sing to Thee,
Heaven's triumphant litany.
