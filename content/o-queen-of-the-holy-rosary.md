title: O Queen of the Holy Rosary

1. O Queen of the Holy Rosary!
Oh, bless us, as we pray,
And offer thee our roses,
In garlands day by day;
While from our Father's garden,
With loving hearts and bold,
We gather to thine honor,
Buds white and red and gold.

2. O Queen of the Holy Rosary!
Each myst'ry blends with thine;
The sacred life of Jesus
In ev'ry step divine,
Thy soul was his fair garden,
Thy virgin breast his throne,
Thy thoughts his faithful mirror,
Reflecting him above.

3. Sweet Lady of the Rosary,
White roses let us bring,
And lay them round thy footstool
Before our Infant King.
For nestling in thy bosom
God's son was fain to be.
The Child of thy obedience
And spotless purity.

4. Dear Lady of the Rosary,
Red roses cast we down,
But let thy fingers weave them
Into a worthy crown.
For how can we poor sinners
Do aught but weep with thee,
When in thy train we follow
Our God to Calvary?
