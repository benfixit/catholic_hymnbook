1. Come Thou long expected Saviour,
Born to set Thy people free;
From our fears and sins release us,
Let us find our rest in thee.
Israel's strength and consolation,
Hope of all the earth Thou art;
Fond desire of every nation,
Joy of every longing heart.

2. Born Thy people to deliver,
Born a child and yet a King,
Born to reign in us forever,
Now Thy gracious kingdom bring.
By thine own eternal spirit,
Rule in all our hearts alone;
By thine all sufficient merit,
Raise us to Thy glorious throne.
