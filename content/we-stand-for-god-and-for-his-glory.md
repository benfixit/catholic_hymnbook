_Chorus:_
_Strengthen our faith Redeemer_
_Guard us when danger is nigh_
_To you we pledge our lives and service_
_Strong in a trust that ne'er shall die_
_To you we pledge our lives and service_
_Strong in a trust that ne'er shall die._

1. We stand for God, and for His glory
The Lord supreme and good of all
Against His foes we raise His standard
Around the Cross we hear His call.

2. We stand for God, let us be loyal
Our love proclaim with every breath
To Christ the King and Lord of lords
We shall be faithful unto death.
