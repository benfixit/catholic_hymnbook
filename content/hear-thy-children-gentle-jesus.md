1. Hear thy children, gentle Jesus,
While we breathe our evening prayer,
Save us from all harm and danger,
Take us 'neath Thy shelt'ring care.
Save us from the wiles of Satan,
'Mid the lone and sleepful night
Sweetly may bright Guardian Angels
Keep us 'neath their watchful sight.

2. Gentle Jesus, look in pity,
From thy glorious throne above:
All the night thy heart is wakeful,
In thy sacrament of love.
Shades of even fast are falling,
Day is fading into gloom.
When the shades of death fall round us,
Lead thine exiled children home.
