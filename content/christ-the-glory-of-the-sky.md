1. Christ, the glory of the sky,
Christ, of earth the hope secure,
Only Son of God most high,
Offspring of a Maiden pure.

2. Help us now thy praise to sing,
Praise for this returning day;
Light and life let morning bring,
Clouds and darkness flee away.

3. Purest Light, within us dwell,
Never from our souls depart;
Come, the shades of earth dispel,
Fill and purify the heart.

4. Faith in him whose name we bear
In our heart of hearts abound;
Hope, thy brightest torch prepare;
All with holy love be crowned.

5. Praise the Father; praise the Son;
Spirit blest, to thee be praise;
To the eternal Three in One
Glory be through endless days.
