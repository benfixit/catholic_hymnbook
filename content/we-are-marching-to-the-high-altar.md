_Chorus:_
_What a beautiful day, a wonderful day_
_We offer our gifts to the Lord_
_There will be no more pain and no more sorrow_
_O what a happy day._

1. We are marching to the higher altar
To offer our bread and wine
To atone for the sins of the whole world
O what a glorious day.

2. Let us break bread at the high altar
In union with our savior
For the grace of peace and unity
O what a happy day.

3. Let us drink wine at the high altar
Where Christ remains ever present
For the love of our dear brethren
O what a happy day.
