1. O Trinity of blessed light,
O Unity of princely might,
The fiery sun now goes his way;
Shed thou within our hearts thy ray.

2. To thee our morning song of praise,
To thee our evening prayer we raise;
O grant us with thy saints on high
To praise thee through eternity.

3. All laud to God the Father be,
All praise, eternal Son, to thee;
All glory, as is ever meet,
To God the holy Paraclete.
