title: O God Thy People Gather
category: entrance

1. O God, thy people gather,
Obedient to thy word,
Around thy holy altar
To praise thy name, O Lord;
For all thy loving kindness
Our grateful hearts we raise;
But pardon first the blindness
Of all our sinful ways.

2. Thou art our loving Father,
Thou art our holiest Lord,
But we have sinned against thee
By thoughts and deed and word.
Before the court of heaven
We stand and humbly pray
Our sins may be forgiven,
Our faults be washed away.

3. Though sinful, we implore thee
To turn and make us live;
That so we may adore thee,
and our due offering give;
And the prayers and voices
Of thy glad people rise,
As thy whole Church rejoices
In this great sacrifice.
