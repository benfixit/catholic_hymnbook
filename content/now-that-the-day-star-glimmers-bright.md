1. Now that the daystar glimmers bright,
We suppliantly pray
That he, the uncreated light,
May guide us on our way.

2. No sinful word, nor deed of wrong,
Nor thoughts that idly rove;
But simple truth be on our tongue,
And in our hearts be love;

3. And, while the hours in order flow,
O Christ, securely fence
Our gates, beleaguer'd by the foe:
The gate of ev'ry sense.

4. And grant that to thine honor, Lord,
Our daily toil may tend;
That we begin it at thy word,
And in thy blessing end;

5. And, lest the flesh in its excess
Should lord it o'er the soul,
Let taming abstinence repress
The rebel, and control

6. To God the Father glory be,
And to his only Son,
And to the Spirit, One and Three,
While endless ages run.
