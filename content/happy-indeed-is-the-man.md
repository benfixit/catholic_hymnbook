_Chorus:_
_Blessed is He who delights in the law of the Lord._

1. Happy indeed is the man who follows
Not the counsel of the wicked,
Nor lingers in the way of sinners
Nor sits in the company of scorners,
But whose delight is the law of the Lord
And who ponders His law day and night.

2. He is like a tree that is planted
Beside the flowing waters,
That yields its fruits in due season
And whose leaves shall never fade;
And all that he does shall propose.
Not so are the wicked, not so!

3. For they like winnowed chaff
Shall be driven away by the wind.
When the wicked are judged, they shall not stand,
Nor find room among those who are just,
For the Lord guards the way of the just,
But the way of the wicked leads to doom.

4. Give praise to the Father Almighty,
To His Son, Jesus Christ, the Lord,
To the Spirit who dwells in our hearts,
Both now and for ever. Amen.
