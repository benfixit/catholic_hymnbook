1. Father, who art in Heaven,
Hallowed be Thy Name;
Thy Kingdom come, Thy will be done,
Hallowed be Thy Name.

2. As in heaven, so on the earth,
Hallowed be Thy Name;
Give us this day our daily bread,
Hallowed be Thy Name.

3. And forgive us, all our trespasses,
Hallowed be Thy Name;
As we forgive those who trespass against us,
Hallowed be Thy Name.

4. And lead us not into temptation,
Hallowed be Thy Name;
But deliver us from all that is evil,
Hallowed be Thy Name.

5. For Thine is the kingdom, the power and the glory
Hallowed be Thy Name
For ever and for ever and ever
Hallowed be Thy name.
