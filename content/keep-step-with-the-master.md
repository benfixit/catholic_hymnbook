title: Keep Step With the Master

---

_Chorus:_
_Keeping step go bravely forward,_
_And thy courage will renew;_
_Daily walk with Christ your Saviour,_
_He will lead you all the journey through._

1. Keep step with the Master, whatever betide;
While dark be the pathway,
Keep close to your Guide,
While foes are alluring,
and danger is near,
When walking with Jesus,
You've nothing to fear.

2. Keep step with the Master, wherever you go;
Through darkness and shadow,
the way He will show,
The light of His presence your path will illume,
And make all the desert a garden of bloom.

3. Keep step with the Master, nor halt by the way;
Whate'er He commands you, oh, haste to obey!
Arise at His bidding, press on in His might;
While walking with Jesus, you're sure to be right.
