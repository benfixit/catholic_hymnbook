_Chorus:_
_Trust and obey_
_For there's no other way_
_To be happy with Jesus_
_But to trust and obey._

1. When we walk with Lord
In the light of His word
What a glory He sheds on our way
While we do His good will
He abides with us still
And with all who will trust and obey.

2. Not a shadow can rise
Not a cloud in the skies
But His smile quickly drives it away
Not a doubt or a fear
Not a sigh or a tear
Can abide while we trust and obey.

3. Not a burden we bear
Not a sorrow we share
But our toil He doth richly repay
Not a grief nor a loss
Not a crown or a cross
But is blest if we trust and obey.

4. But we never can prove
The delight of His love
Until all on the altar we lay
For the favor He shows
And the joy He bestows
Are for them who will trust and obey.
