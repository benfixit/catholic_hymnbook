title: Hark! Hark My Soul

---

_Chorus:_
_Angels of Jesus, angels of light,_
_Singing to welcome the pilgrims of the night._

1. Hark! hark! my soul!
Angelic songs are swelling,
O'er earth's green fields,
And ocean's wavebeat shore;
How sweet the truth,
Those blessed strains are telling,
Of that new life when sin shall be no more.

2. Onward we go,
for still we hear them singing,
Come, weary souls,
for Jesus bids you come,
And through the dark,
its echoes sweetly ringing,
The music of the Gospel leads us home.

3. Far, far away,
like bells at evening pealing,
The voice of Jesus
sounds o'er land and sea,
And laden souls,
by thousands meekly stealing
Kind Shepherd! turn their weary steps to Thee.

4. Rest comes at length,
though life be long and dreary,
The day must dawn
and darksome night be past;
All journeys end
in welcomes to the weary,
And Heaven, the heart's true home, will come at last.

5. Angels! sing on,
your faithful watches keeping,
Sing us sweet fragments
of the songs above,
While we toil on,
And soothe ourselves with weeping,
Till life's long night shall break in endless love.
