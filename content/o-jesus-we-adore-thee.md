_Chorus:_
_O Sacrament most holy,_
_O Sacrament divine,_
_All praise and all thanksgiving_
_Be every moment thine!_

1. O Jesus, we adore thee
Who in thy love divine,
Conceal thy mighty Godhead
In forms of bread and wine.

2. O Jesus, we adore thee,
Our Victim and our Priest,
Whose precious blood and body
Become our sacred feast.

3. O Jesus, we adore thee,
Our Savior and our King,
And with the saints and angels
A Humble homage bring.

4. O Jesus, we adore thee,
Come, live in us, we pray,
That all our thoughts and actions
Be thine alone today.

5. O come, all you who labor
In sorrow and in pain;
Come, eat this bread from heaven,
Your peace and strength regain.
