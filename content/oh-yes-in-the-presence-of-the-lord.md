_Chorus:_
_O yes, in the presence of the Lord,_
_I will bring my gifts_
_In thanksgiving and love_
_There is joy in my heart._
_It is flowing like a river_
_I will praise the Lord,_
_In thanksgiving and love._

1. God our Father, everlasting King
Please accept this gift we offer
In thanksgiving and love;
Take our bread upon Your altar
And our wine in the chalice,
In thanksgiving and love.

2. With thankful hearts and joyful songs,
We approach Your holy altar
In thanksgiving and love;
Bearing gifts of Your creation
We return what You have given,
In thanksgiving and love.

3. To You Father, now we offer,
With the host and with the chalice
In thanksgiving and love;
All we have and all our being
In this sacrifice most holy,
In thanksgiving and love.
