title: Bless Me, Befriend Me
---

1. Bless me, befriend me, sweet angel, I pray;
Watch me defend me by night and by day.
Shelter, enfold me, within thy bright wings:
Guide me, uphold me in life's wanderings.

2. Beam on my gladness, thy joy shall I share;
Shine on my sadness, and sorrow I'll bear.
Go thou before me, my path shall be clear,
Hover thou o'er me, no foe shall I fear.

3. Angel so holy! whom God sends to me,
Sinful and lowly, my guardian to be.
Wilt thou not cherish the child of thy care?
Let me not perish, my trust is thy prayer.

4. O, may I never forget thou art near;
Keep, keep me ever in love and in fear.
Waking and sleeping, in labor and rest,
In thy sweet keeping my life shall be blest.

5. Till my last sorrow I'll walk in thy light;
Till the tomorrow eternal and bright.
Till thy soft pinions shall waft me on high,
To those dominions more fair than the sky.
