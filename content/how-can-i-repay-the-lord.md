category: offertory

_Chorus:_
_How can I repay the Lord_
_For his goodness to me_
_I will raise the cup of salvation,_
_I will call on God's name._

1. I trusted even when I said:
"I am sorely afflicted"
And when I said in my alarm:
"No man can be trusted"

2. How can I repay the Lord
For His goodness to me?
The cup of salvation I will raise:
I will call on the Lord's name.

3. My vows to the Lord I will fulfil
Before all his people,
O precious in the eyes of the Lord
Is the death of His faithful.

4. Your servant Lord your servant am I,
You have loosened my bonds.
A thanksgiving sacrifice I make,
I will call on the Lord's name.

5. My vows to the Lord I will fulfil
Before all his people
In the courts of the house of the
Lord, in your midst O Jerusalem.

6. Praise the Father, the Son, and Holy Spirit
Both now and forever,
The God who is, who was and is to come,
At the end of the ages.
