1. I know that my Redeemer lives!
What joy the blest assureance gives!
He lives, he lives, who once was dead;
He lives, my everlasting head!

2. He lives triumphant from the grave;
He lives eternally to save;
He lives in majesty above;
He lives to guide his Church in love.

3. He lives to silence all my fears;
He lives to wipe away my tears;
He lives to calm my troubled heart;
He lives all blessings to impart.

4. He lives, all glory to his name!
He lives, my Savior, still the same;
What joy this blest assurance gives;
I know that my Redeemer lives!
