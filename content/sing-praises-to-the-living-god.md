title: Sing Praises to the Living God

---

_Chorus:_
_Glory to the Trinity,_
_The undivided unity,_
_The Father, son, and Spirit one,_
_From whom all life and goodness come._

1. Sing praises to the living God,
Glory Alleluia.
Come, adore the living God,
Glory Alleluia.
Though sun and moon may pass away,
His word will ever stay.
His power is forevermore,
Glory Alleluia.

2. To the living God we sing,
Glory Alleluia.
Let our love and praises ring,
Glory Alleluia.
To His sons He always gives
His mercy and His love.
Praise Him now forevermore,
Glory Alleluia.

3. To the God who cannot die,
Glory Alleluia.
To the living God we cry,
Glory Alleluia.
He promised to be with us
and He lives in everyone.
Love Him now forevermore,
Glory Alleluia.
