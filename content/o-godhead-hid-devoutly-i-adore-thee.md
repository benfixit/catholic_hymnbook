1. O Godhead hid, devoutly I adore Thee,
Who truly art within the forms before me;
To Thee my heart I bow with bended knee,
As failing quite in contemplating Thee.

2. Sight, touch, and taste in Thee are each deceived;
The ear alone most safely is believ'd:
I believe all the Son of God has spoken,
Than Truth's own word there is no truer token.

3. God only, on the Cross lay hid from view;
But here lies hid at once the Manhood too:
And I, in both professing my belief,
Make the same prayer as the repentant thief.

4. Thy wounds, as Thomas saw, I do not see;
Yet Thee confess my Lord and God to be:
Make me believe Thee ever more and more;
In Thee my hope, in Thee my love to store.

5. O Thou Memorial of our Lord's own dying!
O Bread that living art and vivifying!
Make ever Thou my soul on Thee to live;
Ever a taste of Heavenly sweetness give.

6. O loving Pelican! O Jesu, Lord!
Unclean I am, but cleanse me in thy Blood;
Of which a single drop, for sinners spilt,
Is ransom for a world's entire guilt.

7. Jesu! whom for the present veil'd I see,
What I so thirst for, oh, vouchsafe to me:
That I may see Thy countenance unfolding,
And may be blest Thy glory in beholding.
