_Chorus:_
_Priestly people, Kingly people, holy people._
_God's chosen people, sing praise to the Lord._

1. We sing to you,
O Christ, beloved son of the father.
We give you praise,
O wisdom everlasting and Word of God.

2. We sing to you,
O son born of Mary the Virgin.
We give you praise,
Our Brother, born to heal us, our saving lord.

3. We sing to you,
O brightness of splendour and glory.
We give you praise,
O morning star announcing the coming day.

4. We sing to you,
O light bringing men out of darkness.
We give you praise,
O guiding light who shows us the way to heaven.

5. We sing to you,
Messiah foretold by the prophets.
We give you praise,
O son of David and son of Abraham.

6. We sing to you,
Messiah, the hope of the people.
We give you praise,
O Christ our Lord and king, humble meek of heart.

7. We sing to you,
the Way to the Father in Heaven;
We give you praise,
The Way of truth and way of all grace and light.

8. We sing to you,
O Priest of the new dispensation;
We give you praise,
Our pearl sealed by the blood of the sacrifice.

9. We sing to you,
the tabernacle made by the Father.
We give you praise,
the Cornerstone and Saviour of Israel.
