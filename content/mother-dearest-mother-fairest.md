_Chorus:_
_Mary, help us, help we pray,_
_Mary, help us, help we pray,_
_Help us in all care and sorrow:_
_Mary, help us, help we pray._

1. Mother dearest, Mother fairest,
Help of all who call on thee,
Virgin purest, brightest rarest,
Help us, help, we cry to thee.

2. Lady, help in pain and sorrow,
Soothe those rack'd on beds of pain,
May the golden light of morrow,
Bring them health and joy again.

3. Help our priests, our virgins holy,
Help our Pope, long may he reign,
Pray that we who sing thy praises,
May in heav'n all meet again.

4. Lady, help the wounded soldier,
Set the pining captive free,
Help the sailor in mid-ocean,
Help those in their agony.

5. Lady, help the absent loved ones,
How we miss their presence here,
May the hand of thy protection
Guide and guard them far and near.
