1. Dear Guardian of Mary! dear nurse of her Child!
Life's ways are full weary, the desert is wild,
Bleak sands are all round us, no home can we see;
Sweet Spouse of our Lady, we lean safe on thee.

2. For thou to the pilgrim art father and guide,
And Jesus and Mary felt safe at thy side.
O Glorious Patron, secure shall I be,
Sweet Spouse of our Lady, if thou stay with me!

3. God chose thee for Jesus and Mary; wilt thou
Forgive a poor exile for choosing thee now?
There's no saint in heaven, Saint Joseph like thee,
Sweet Spouse of our Lady, do thou plead for me.

4. When the treasures of God were unsheltered on earth,
Safe keeping was found for them both in thy worth,
O Father of Jesus! be father to me,
Sweet Spouse of our Lady, and I will love thee.
