_Chorus:_
_Great and glorious St. Patrick,_
_Pray for thy dear country._
_Great and glorious St. Patrick,_
_Hearken to the prayers of your children._

1. Hibernia's champion saint all hail,
With fadeless glory crown'd;
The offspring of your ardent zeal,
This day your praise shall sound.

2. Borne on the wings of charity,
To Erin's coast you flew,
Bade Satan from her valleys flee,
And his dark shrines o'erthrew.

3. Wandering thro' error's gloomy night
Our sires did lose their way;
You cheered their hearts with heavenly light
With truth's counselling ray.

4. Oh what a harvest crown your toil;
The earth long cursed was blest.
Each lovely virtue graced its soil,
The sinner's hearts found rest.
