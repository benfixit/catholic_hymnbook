_Chorus:_
_Men and angels sing in chorus_
_And adoring bend the knee!_
_Praise our God whom here before us_
_In the sacred host we adore._

1. Sing with joy the Saviour's glory
Of his flesh the mystery sing;
Of the blood all price exceeding,
Shed by our immortal king.

2. On the night of his last supper
Seated with his chosen band
He as food to all his brethren
Gave himself with his own hand.

3. While we bow in adoration,
Let our hearts his gift revere;
Faith its aid to vision lending,
Tells that he unseen is here.
