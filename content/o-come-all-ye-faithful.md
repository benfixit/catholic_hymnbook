_Chorus:_
_O come, let us adore him,_
_O come, let us adore him,_
_O come, let us adore him,_
_Christ the Lord_

1. O come, all ye faithful, joyful and triumphant;
O come ye, O come ye to Bethlehem.
Come and behold him, born the King of angels;

2. God of God, Light of Light,
Lo! he abohors not the Virgin's womb;
Very God, begotten, not created;

3. Sing, choirs of angels, sing in exultation;
Sing, all ye citizens of heav'n above!
Glory to god, glory in the highest;

4. Yea, Lord we greet thee, Born this happy morning,
Jesus, to thee be all glory giv'n;
Word of the Father, now in flesh appering;
