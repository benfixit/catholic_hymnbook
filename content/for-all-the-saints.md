title: For All the Saints

_Chorus:_
_Alleluia, Alleluia!_

1. For all the saints who from their labors rest,
Who thee by faith before the world confessed;
Thy name, O Jesus, be forever blest.

2. Thou wast their Rock, their Fortress and their Might;
Thou, Lord, their Captain in the wellfought fight;
Thou, in the darkness drear, their one true light.

3. O blest communion, fellowship divine!
We feebly struggle, they in glory shine;
Yet all are one in thee, for all are thine.

4. And when the strife is fierce, the warfare long,
Steals on the ear the distant triumph song,
And hearts are brave again, and arms are strong.

5. But then there breaks a still more glorious day;
The saints triumphant rise in bright array;
The King of glory passes on his way.

6. From earth's wide bounds, from oceans farthest coast,
Through gates of pearl streams in the countless host;
Singing to Father, Son and Holy Ghost.
