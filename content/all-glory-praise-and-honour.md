_Refrain:_
_All glory, praise, and honour_
_to Thee, Redeemer King!_
_To whom the lips of children_
_make sweet hosannas ring!_

1. True King art Thou, Lord Jesus,
Of David's royal line!
Our King by right eternal
Both human and divine.

2. The saints and angels praise Thee,
While men on earth proclaim
Thy rule of love and mercy,
In hearts that bless Thy name!
