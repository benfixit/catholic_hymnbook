_Chorus:_
_"Lord thy glory fills the heaven,_
_Earth is with thy fullness stored;_
_Unto thee be glory given,_
_Holy, holy, holy Lord"_

1. Round the Lord in glory seated,
Cherubim and seraphim
Filled his temple, and repeated
Each to each th'alternate hymn:

2. Heav'n is still with glory ringing;
Earth takes up the angels' cry,
"Holy, holy, holy", singing,
"Lord of Hosts, the Lord Most High!"

3. With his seraph train before him,
With his holy Church below,
Thus conspire we to adore him,
Bid we thus our anthem flow:

4. Thus thy glorious name confessing,
With thine angel hosts we cry,
"Holy, holy, holy," blessing
Thee, the Lord of Hosts Most High.
