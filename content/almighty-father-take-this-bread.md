1. Almighty Father take this bread
Your people offer you;
Where sins divide us take instead,
One fold, one family.

2. The wine we offer soon will be
Christ's blood, redemption's price.
Receive it Holy Trinity,
this holy sacrifice.

3. O God, by angels' choir adored,
Your name be praised on earth;
On all men be that peace outpoured,
once promised at his birth.
