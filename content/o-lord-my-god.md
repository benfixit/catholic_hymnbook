_Chorus:_
_Then sings my soul, My Saviour God, to Thee,_
_"How great Thou art, How great Thou art!"_
_Then sings my soul, My Saviour God, to Thee,_
_"How great Thou art, How great Thou art!"_

1. O Lord my God, When I in awesome wonder,
Consider all the worlds Thy Hands have made;
I see the stars, I hear the rolling thunder,
Thy power throughout the universe displayed.

2. When through the woods and forest glades I wander
And hear the birds sing sweetly in the trees,
When I look down from lofty mountain grandeur,
And hear the brook and feel the gentle breeze.

3. And when I think how God, his Son not sparing,
Sent him to die, I scarce can take it in;
That on the cross, my burdens gladly bearing,
He bled and died to take away my sin.

4. When Christ shall come with shouts of acclamation,
To take me home, what joy will fill my heart!
Then I shall bow in humble adoration,
And there proclaim, "My God, how great thou art!"
