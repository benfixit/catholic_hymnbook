title: Great is Thy Faithfulness
---

_Chorus:_
_Great is Thy faithfulness!_
_Great is Thy faithfulness!_
_Morning by morning new mercies I see_
_All I have needed Thy hand hath provided_
_Great is Thy faithfulness, Lord unto me!_

1. Great is Thy faithfulness, O God my Father;
There is no shadow of turning with Thee,
Thou changest not, Thy compassions they fail not,
As Thou hast been, Thou forever wilt be.

2. Summer and winter and springtime and harvest,
Sun, moon, and stars in their courses above;
Join with all nature in manifold witness,
To Thy great faithfulness, mercy, and love.

3. Pardon for sin and a peace that endureth,
Thine own great presence to cheer and to guide;
Strength for today, and bright hope for tomorrow
Blessings all mine, with ten thousand beside.
