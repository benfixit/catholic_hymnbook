title: O God You are My Strength
---

1. O God, You are my strength,
why have You rejected me?
Send forth Your light and Your truth,
They will guide me to Your holy hill.
I will go to the altar of God,
and I will glorify Him in song.
Why are you depressed, my soul?
Hope in God, trust in His goodness.
