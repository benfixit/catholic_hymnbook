1. We're going with Jesus, walking together
Over the path He has trod
And up every mountain , down every valley
We walk along with God.

2. We're walking for the Lord on earth
Until we find it true
The good you do will all come back
A hundred fold to you.

3. We heard His word, we know it true
He came to save the world
Then tell the people, all the people
Jesus keeps His word.
