1. Mother of Christ, Mother of Christ,
What shall I ask of thee?
I do not sigh for the walth of earth,
For the joys that fade and flee;
But Mother of Christ, Mother of Christ,
This do I long to see,
The bliss untold which thine arms enfold,
The treasure upon thy knee.

2. Mother of Christ, Mother of Christ,
What shall I do for thee?
I will love thy son with the whole of my strength,
My only King shall he be.
Yes, Mother of Christ, Mother of Christ,
This will I do for thee,
Of all that are dear or cherished here,
None shall be dear as he.

3. Mother of Christ, Mother of Christ,
I toss on a stormy sea,
O lift thy Child as a beacon light
To the port where I fain would be.
And, Mother of Christ, Mother of Christ,
This do I ask of thee,
When the voyage is o'er, O stand on the shore,
And show him at last to me.
