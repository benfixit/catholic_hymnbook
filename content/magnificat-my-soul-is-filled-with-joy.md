title: Magnificat- My Soul Is Filled With Joy

---

_Chorus:_
_Through all generations!_
_Everlasting is your mercy_
_To the people you have chosen,_
_And holy is your name._

1. My soul is filled with joy;
As I sing to God my saviour;
He has looked upon His servant;
He has visited His people;
And holy is your name.

2. I am lowly as a child;
But I know from this day forward;
That my name will be remembered;
For all men will call me blessed;
And holy is your name.

3. I proclaim the pow'r of God;
He does marvels for His servants;
Though He scatters the proud-hearted;
And destroys the might of princes;
And holy is your name.

4. To the hungry He gives food;
Sends the rich away empty;
In His mercy He is mindful;
Of the people He has chosen;
And holy is your name.

5. In His love He now fulfills;
What He promised to our fathers;
I will praise the Lord, my saviour;
Everlasting is His mercy;
And holy is your name.

6. Praise the Father, Son and Spirit;
As it was in the beginning;
Is now and ever shall be;
World without end. Amen;
And holy is your name.
