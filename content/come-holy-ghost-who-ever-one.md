title: Come, Holy Ghost, Who Ever One

---

1. Come, Holy Ghost, who ever one
Are with our Father and the Son;
Come, Holy Ghost, our souls possess
With your full flood of holiness.

2. In will and deed, by heart and tongue,
With all our pow'rs, your praise be sung;
And love light up our mortal frame,
Till others catch the living flame.

3. Almighty father, hear our cry
Through Jesus Christ our Lord most High,
Whom with the Spirit we adore
And sing your praise forever-more.
