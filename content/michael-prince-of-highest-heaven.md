_Chorus:_
_Michael, Prince of highest heav'n,_
_Noblest of celestial ranks,_
_Lowly singing in thine honor,_
_Bring we now our meed of thanks,_
_Bring we now our meed of thanks._

1. Mighty victor all resplendent,
Next to Mary thou dost reign;
Come and bless us with thy presence,
Bring with thee thy heav'nly train.

2. Gabriel, silver tongued and glorious,
Raphael, healer of our woes,
Blessed angels, gentle guardians,
be our aid, repel our foes.

3. Breathe into our hearts your sweetness,
Fill our souls with love divine,
May your gracious presence ever
Round your charge protecting shine.
