title: Children in Thy Presence Met
---

1. Children in Thy presence met,
Fill our hearts with holy fear;
Father, be compassionate;
God of mercy, hear.

2. Though we do not yet by sight,
God most high, behold Thy face,
Pour into our minds the light
Of Thy saving grace.

3. Tender Father, gracious Friend,
Mighty one, tremendous Lord,
Unto all the ages' end,
Be Thy name adored.

4. Glory to the Father be;
To the uncreated Son;
Blessed Spirit, praise to Thee;
God for ever One.
