title: Bright the Vision That Delighted

---

1. Bright the vision that delighted
Once the sight of Judah's seer;
Sweet the countless tongues united
To entrance the prophet's ear.

2. Round the Lord in glory seated
Cherubim and seraphim
Filled his temple, and repeated
Each to each th'alternate hymn:

3. 'Lord, thy glory fills the heaven;
Earth is with its fullness stored;
Unto thee be glory given,
Holy, holy, holy, Lord.'

4. Heaven is still with glory ringing,
Earth takes up the angel's cry,
'Holy, holy, holy', singing,
'Lord of hosts, the Lord most high'.

5. With his seraph train before him,
With his holy Church below,
Thus unite we to adore him,
Bid we thus our anthem flow:

6. 'Lord, thy glory fills the heaven;
Earth is with its fullness stored;
Unto thee be glory given,
Holy, holy, holy, Lord.'
