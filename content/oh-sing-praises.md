_Chorus:_
_Oh! sing praises, Oh! sing praises,_
_Sing praises, sing praises, sing praises,_
_To God most high._

1. Oh! sing praises, Oh! sing praises,
O sing praises to God most high.

2. For His goodness and compassion
Is bestowed upon His children.

3. For He is good and He made us
to adore Him forever.

4. For He is love, He loves us,
Let us love one another.
