1. Beautiful Savior,
Mightiest in Mercy,
Light piercing darkness,
Joy beyond all sorrow,
Wounded for healing,
Dying for our saving,
Victim and High Priest.

2. Son of the Father,
Child of Mary Mother,
Just Joshep's dear boy,
Cause of Great John's leaping,
Mary's Deliv'rer,
Truest friend to Laz'rus
True God, our High King.

3. All laud we bring now
Praising our Beloved,
Christ Jesus, Savior,
Victor and Redeemer,
Judge of the Living,
Judge of the departed,
Come quickly, Jesus.
