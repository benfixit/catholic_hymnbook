title: One Thought Only Have We
---

_Chorus:_
_Seeking heaven alone,_
_Brings true happiness;_
_Seeking heaven alone,_
_Brings true happiness;_
_Seeking heaven alone,_
_Seeking heaven alone._

1. One thought only have we
As we journey,
'Tis our souls' salvation
That and that alone.

2. Each soul was created
For a God most high;
Naught but God, our yearnings,
E'er can satisfy.

3. Life on earth is passing,
Vanity and show;
God alone is changeless,
God alone is true.

4. Though we gain the whole world,
Poor are we indeed;
If we lose our Jesus,
For eternity.

5. Seek then, but salvation,
Seek that peace and joy;
Which endure forever,
Bliss without alloy.

6. Maiden Mother, lead me
To my Saviour's throne;
Keep and guard and guide me
Make me all His own.
