title: The Earth, O Lord, Rejoices
---

1. The earth, O Lord, rejoices,
And sings with glad acclaim,
A hymn of many voices,
In honour of thy name.
We join the happy chorus,
That hails the morning light;
And bless the Lord that o'er us,
Kept loving watch all night.

2. Our every thought and action,
We offer up to Thee;
From folly and distraction,
We beg Thee keep us free.
Let no profane example,
No censure, no applause,
Lead us this day to trample,
O Lord, upon Thy laws.

3. It pleased Thee, Lord, to make us,
That we might serve Thee here;
Let not Thy grace forsake us,
But keep us in Thy fear.
Preserve our life, O Father,
That we may serve Thee still;
But let us lose it rather
Than disobey Thy will.
