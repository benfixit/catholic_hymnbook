title: Hail, Queen of Heaven

1. Hail Queen of heav'n, the ocean star,
Guide of the wand'rer here below!
Thrown on life's surge we claim thy care,
Save us from peril and from woe.
Mother of Christ, Star of the Sea,
Pray for the wanderer, pray for me!

2. O gentle, chaste, and spotless maid,
We sinners make our prayers through thee,
Remind thy Son that he has paid
The price of our iniquity.
Virgin most pure, Star of the Sea,
Pray for the sinner, O pray for me!

3. Sojourners in this vale of tears,
To thee, blest Advocate, we cry,
Pity our sorrows, calm our fears
And soothe with hope our misery.
Refuge in grief, Star of the sea,
Pray for the mourner, O pray for me!

4. And while to him who reigns above,
In Godhead one, in persons three,
The source of life, of grace, of love,
Homage we pay on bended knee.
Do thou bright Queen, Star of the sea,
Pray for thy children, O pray for me!
