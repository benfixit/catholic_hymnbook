title: Sing them Over Again to Me
---

_Chorus:_
_Beautiful words, wonderful words,_
_Wonderful words of life;_
_Beautiful words, wonderful words,_
_Wonderful words of life._

1. Sing them over again to me,
Wonderful words of life;
Let me more of their beauty see,
Wonderful words of life;
Words of life and beauty
Teach me faith and duty.

2. Christ, the blessed one, gives to all
Wonderful words of life;
Sinner, list to the loving call,
Wonderful words of life;
All so freely given,
Wooing us to heaven.

3. Sweetly echo the gospel call,
Wonderful words of life;
Offer pardon and peace to all,
Wonderful words of life;
Jesus, only Savior,
Sanctify forever.
