title: To Jesus' Heart All Burning
---

_Chorus:_
_While ages course along,_
_Blest be with loudest song_
_The Sacred Heart of Jesus_
_By ev'ry heart and tongue,_
_The Sacred Heart of Jesus_
_By ev'ry heart and tongue._

1. To Jesus' heart all burning
With fervent love for men,
My heart with fondest yearning
Shall raise the joyful strain.

2. O heart for me on fire
With love no man can speak,
My yet untold desire
God gives me for thy sake.

3. Too true, I have forsaken
Thy love for wilful sin,
Yet now let me be taken
Back by thy grace again.

4. As thou art meek and lowly,
And ever pure at heart,
So may my heart so wholly
Of thine the counterpart.
