title: Now, My Tongue, the Mystery Telling
---

1. Now, my tongue, the myst'ry telling,
Of the glorious body sing,
And the blood, all price excelling,
Which the nations' Lord and King,
Once on earth among us dwelling,
Shed for this world's ransoming.

2. Giv'n for us, and condescending
To be born for us below,
He, with us in converse blending,
Dwelt the seed of truth to sow,
Till he closed with wondrous ending
His most patient life of woe.

3. The last night, at supper lying
With the twelve, his chosen band,
Jesus, with the law complying,
Keeps the feast its rites demand;
Then, more precious food supplying,
Gives himself with this own hand.

4. Word made flesh, by word he maketh
Very bread his flesh to be,
Wine his blood for whoso taketh;
And if senses fail to see,
Faith alone the true heart waketh
To behold the mystery.

5. Therefore we, before him bending,
This great sacrament revere;
Types and shadows have their ending,
For the newer rite is here;
Faith, our outward sense befriending,
Makes our inward vision clear

6. Glory let us give, and blessing,
To the Father and the Son;
Honor, thanks, and praise addressing
While eternal ages run,
And the Spirit's power confessing,
Who from both with both is one.
