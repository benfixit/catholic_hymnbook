1. Greet we this mystery yearly returning
Still doth its history set our hearts burning:
Gone are the former things,
All shall be new again,
Thoughts, words, actions be true again.

2. Christ, in the sight of His brethren reclining
On that last night of His, gave them for dining
Bread where no leaven was,
Lamb that was slain for them.
So did Moses ordain for them.

3. After that offering made for a token
There stood He proffering His body broken,
Now in those hands of His,
Now within reach of them,
Whole for all as for each of them.

4. His body fortified spirits that sickened;
Hearts sad and mortified His blood requickened;
"Drink of this cup that is offered"
He said "for you
Drink my blood that is shed for you."
