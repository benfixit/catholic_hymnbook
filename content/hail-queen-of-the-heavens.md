1. Hail Queen of the Heavens, Hail Mistress of earth
Hail Virgin most pure, of immaculate birth,
Clear Star of the morning, in beauty enshrined,
O Mary make speed to the help of mankind.
Clear Star of the morning, in beauty enshrined,
O Mary make speed to the help of mankind.

2. Hail Mother most pur, Hail Virgin renowned.
Hail Queen with the stars as diadem crowned,
Above all the angels in glory untold,
Standing next to the King in a vesture of gold,
Above all the angels in glory untold,
Standing next to the King in a vesture of gold.

3. O Mother of mercy, O Star of the sea,
O Hope of the guilty, O light of the grave,
Thro' thee way we come to the Heaven of rest,
And see Heaven's King, in the courts of the Blest,
Thro' thee way we come to the Heaven of rest,
And see Heaven's King, in the courts of the Blest.
