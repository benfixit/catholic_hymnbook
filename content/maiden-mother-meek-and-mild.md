title: Maiden Mother, Meek and Mild
---

1. Maiden Mother, meek and mild,
Take, oh, take me for thy child,
All my life, oh, let it be
My best joy to think of thee,
Virgo María!

2. Teach me, when the sunbeam bright,
Calls me with its golden light,
How my waking thoughts may be,
Turned to Jesus and to thee,
Virgo María!

3. Teach me also through the day
Oft to raise my heart and say,
"Maiden Mother, meek and mild,
Guard, oh, guard thy faithful child!"
Virgo María!

4. When my eyes are closed in sleep,
Through the night my slumbers keep,
Make my latest thought to be
How to love thy Son and thee,
Virgo María!

5. Thus, sweet Mother, day and night
Thou shalt guide my steps aright;
And my dying words shall be
“Virgin Mother, pray for me!”
Virgo María!
