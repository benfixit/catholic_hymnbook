---

1. The sun is sinking fast,
The daylight dies;
Let love awake, and pay
Her evening sacrifice.

2. As Christ upon the Cross,
In death reclined,
Into his Father's hands
His parting soul resigned.

3. So now herself my soul
Would wholly give
Into his sacred charge
In whom all spirits live;

4. So now beneath his eye
Would calmly rest,
Without a wish or thought
Abiding in the breast,

5. Save that his will be done,
Whate'er betide,
Dead to herself, and dead
In him to all aside.

6. Thus would I live; yet now
Not I, but he
In all his power and love
Henceforth alive in me -

7. One sacred Trinity,
One Lord divine,
Myself for ever his
And he for ever mine!
