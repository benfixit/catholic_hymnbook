title: Take Me Deeper in Love with You
---

_Chorus:_
_Take me deeper in love with you_
_Jesus, O deeper in love_
_Hold me, closer in love with you_
_Jesus, closer in love with you._

1. Lord there is a longing only you can fill
A raging tempest only you can still
My souls is thirsting for you my God
God quench my thirst, Lord feed my soul.

2. Yes from sunrise to sunrise I seek your face
From day to day I long for your touch
To hold my hand Lord lest I fall
To draw me nearer, closer to thee.

3. In your love is found great faithfulness
Your love is filled with hope and peace
Your love is filled with compassion and joy
O teach me Lord to love you back.
