title: The First Noel, The Angel Did Say
---

_Chorus:_
_Noel, Noel, Noel, Noel,_
_born is the King of Israel._

1. The first Noel the angel did say
Was to certain poor shepherds in fields as they lay;
In fields where they lay keeping their sheep
On a cold winter's night that was so deep.

2. They looked above and there saw a star
that shone in the east, beyond them afar;
And which to earth did give a great light,
And so it continued by day and night.

3. And by the light of that same star
Three wise men came from country far;
To seek for a king was their intent,
And to follow the star wherever it went.

4. This star drew near to the northwest,
At lenght o'er Bethlehem seemed to rest;
And there it stayed by night and by day,
Right over the place where Jesus lay.

5. Then entered in those wise men three,
Most reverently with bended knee,
And offered there, in His presence,
Both gold and myrrh with frankincense.

6. Then let us all with one accord,
Sing praises to our heavenly Lord;
That made both heaven and earth of nought,
And with his blood mankind has bought.
