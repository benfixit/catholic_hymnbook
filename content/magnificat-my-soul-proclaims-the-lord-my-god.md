title: Magnificat- My Soul Proclaims the Lord My God

---

1. My soul proclaims the Lord my God;
My spirit sings His praise;
He looks on me, He lifts me up;
And gladness fills my days.

2. All nations now will share my joy;
His gift He has outpoured;
His little one He has made great
I magnify the Lord.

3. His mercy is forever more;
His name I praise again;
His strong right arm puts down the proud;
God raises lowly men.

4. He fills the hungry with good things;
The rich He sends away;
The promise made to Abraham;
Is 'filled by Him each day.

5. Magnificat, Magnificat;
Magnificat, Praise God;
Magnificat, Magnificat;
Magnificat, Praise God.
