_Chorus:_
_We are your bread now_
_He is our life now_
_We are your bread now_
_The bread of love are we_
_We are your heart  now_
_We are your flesh now_
_We  are your bread now_
_The bread of love are we._

1. With one heart and one voice
We sing to him we know
In the breaking of the bread
Of our people and ourselves
A song of love with heart
Full open and full free
In the word of Him
Who melodies our lives

2. Give us this day, O Lord
Our daily bread
The bread of all we do
And all this day we are to meet
Take us with trust
To every table that you set
That we never be afraid
To take and eat.

3. With joy I hear
The beauty of His words
Make this your own body
My body and all we do
And the thrill of a heart
That is happy just to know
That the grain of me
Is next to you.

4. Many the grains but one
The bread we form
In the wonder
Of a thousand loaves
We stand here rich and poor
I am yours and you are mine
And we all are Christ's the Lord
And He O joy is God.
