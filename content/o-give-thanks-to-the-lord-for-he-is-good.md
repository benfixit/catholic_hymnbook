1. O give thanks to the Lord for He is good,
Great is His love love without end,
Give thanks to the God of gods,
Great is His love love without end,
Give thanks to the Lord of lords.
Great is His love, love without end.

2. Who alone has wrought marvellous works
Great is His love, love without end
Whose wisdom it was made the skies,
Great is His love, love without end,
Who spread the earth on the seas.
Great is His love, love without end.

3. It was He who made the great lights,
Great is His love, love without end,
The sun to rule in the day,
Great is His love; love without end,
The moon and stars in the night.
Great is His love, love without end.

4. The first-born of the Egyptians He smote,
Great is His love, love without end,
Brought Israel out from their midst,
Great is His love, love without end,
Arm outstretched, with power in His hand.
Great is His love, love without end.

5. He divided the Red Sea in two,
Great is His love, love without end,
Made Israel pass through the midst,
Great is His love, love without end,
Flung Pharaoh and his force in the sea,
Great is His love, love without end.

6. Through the desert His people He led,
Great is His love, love without end,
Nations in their greatness He struck,
Great is His love, love without end,
Kings in their splendour He slew
Great is His love, love without end.

7. He let Israel inherit their land,
Great is His love, love without end,
On His servants their land He bestowed,
Great is His love, love without end,
He remembered us in our distress.
Great is His love, love without end.

8. And He snatched us away from our foes,
Great is His love, love without end,
He gives food to all living things,
Great is His love, love without end
To the God of heaven give thanks.
Great is His love, love without end.
