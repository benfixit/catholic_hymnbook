title: See the Church Assembled Here
---

1. See the Church assembled here,
See the Church in common prayer;
See the family of God,
Gathered here today.
Closer than we understand,
Mystery of Unity,
Lord, make us always one,
Lord, make us always one.

2. Christ the Lord, our offering,
Christ the Lord, our sacrifice,
Christ the Lord, our common meal,
Present here today;
Offering himself in us,
Food for every one of us.
Lord, make us one with him,
Lord, make us one with him.
