_Chorus:_
_Dear Savior, haste;_
_Come, come to earth,_
_Dispel the night and show thy face,_
_And bid us hail the dawn of grace._
_O come, divine Messiah;_
_The world in silence waits the day_
_When hope shall sing its triumph_
_and sadness flee away._

1. O come, divine Messiah!
The world in silence waits the day
When hope shall sing its triumph,
And sadness flee away.

2. O thou, whom nations sighted for,
Whom priests and prophets long fortold,
Wilt break the captive fetters,
Redeem the long lost fold.

3. Shalt come, in peace and meekness,
And lowly will thy cradle be;
All clothed in human weakness
Shall we thy Godhead see.
