title: Hail Thou Star of Ocean

---

1. Hail, thou Star of Ocean,
Portal of the sky,
Ever Virgin Mother
Of the Lord most high!
Oh, by Gabriel's Ave,
Utter'd long ago,
Eva's name reversing,
'Stablish peace below.

2. Break the captive's fetters,
Light on darkness pour;
All our ills expelling,
Every bliss implore.
Show thyself a mother,
Offer Him our sighs;
Who for us incarnate
Did not thee despise.

3. Virgin of all virgins,
To thy shelter take us;
Gentlest of the gentle,
Chaste and gentle make us.
Still as on we journey,
Help our weak endeavour;
Till with thee and Jesus
We rejoice for ever.

4. Through the highest heaven,
To the all-holy Three,
Father, Son, and Spirit,
One same glory be.
