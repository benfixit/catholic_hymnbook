title: Christ, the True Light of Us

---

1. Christ, the true light of us, true morn,
Dispersing far the shades of night,
Light whereof ev'ry light is born,
Pledge of the beatific light.

2. Thou all the night our guardian be,
Whose watch no sleep or slumber knows;
Thou be our peace, that stayed on thee
Through darkness we may find repose.

3. But let no sloth our will be dim
Nor Satan steal the burdened sense,
Lest the frail flesh, in league with him,
Lose before thee its innocence.

4. Sleep then our eyes, but never sleep
The watchful heaven-directed heart,
And may thy hand in safety keep
The servants whose desire thou art.

5. Look on us thou, and at our side
Our foes and thine repulse afar;
Through every ill the faithful guide
Who in thy blood redeemed are.

6. While soul within the body clings,
Body and soul defend us, Lord,
Sure in the shadow of thy wings,
Kept in thy lasting watch and ward.
