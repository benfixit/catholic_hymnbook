category: offertory

_Chorus:_
_And so I will give You all I have received_
_Lord my offerings to You_
_Which I offer with my friends today_
_Transform them and transform us_
_Purify them and purify us_
_In this sacrifice divine_
_For always Lord You know that_
_I have given all I had._

1. When I remember what You've done for me
My heart leaps for joy for there's none like You
When I remember that You died for me
My heart leaps for joy for there's none like You.

2. There was a time in life when I thought all was lost
Lord I am a living testimony of Your love
You changed my story of woes to joy
Lord I am a living testimony of Your love.

3. Many cannot see, many cannot hear
I am blessed with these, glory be to God
Many have no food, many have no home
I am blessed with these, glory be to God.

4. I will tell this story to my neighbors
I will tell this story to all my friends
I will sing for You, I will praise Your name
I will dance for You for there is none like You.
