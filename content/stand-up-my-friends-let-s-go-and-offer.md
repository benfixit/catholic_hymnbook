_Chorus:_
_Father, take our offerings, take our offerings, take our offerings_
_Father, take the poor offerings which we bring._

1. Stand up my friends let's go and offer,
Offer our gifts to the Father above.

2. Do not mind, do not mind
Do not mind as our gifts are so small.

3. We offer them, we offer them
We offer them together with our hearts.

4. Receive this bread, receive this bread
Receive this bread which we have given.

5. Receive this wine, receive this wine.
Receive the wine which we have given.
