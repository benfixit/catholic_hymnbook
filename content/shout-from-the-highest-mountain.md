title: Shout From the Highest Mountain
---

_Chorus:_
_Shout from the highest mountain,_
_The glory of the Lord,_
_Let all men rejoice in Him,_
_Sing from the highest mountain,_
_The praises of the Lord,_
_Let all men know the wonders of our God._

1. For all the good things the Lord hath done for us,
Let us shout out with joy!

2. For all the birds in the trees and the sky,
And all nature as well.

3. For all the children who play in the fields,
May they always be young.

4. For all the people who follow his way
Those who bring joy to men.

5. And for our country in war and in peace,
May we always be free.
