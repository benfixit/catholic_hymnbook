title: Lord Dismiss Us With Your Blessing
---

1. Lord, dismiss us with Your blessing;
Fill our hearts with joy and peace;
Let us each, Your love possessing,
Triumph in redeeming grace:
O refresh us, O refresh us,
As we work to keep a-pace.

2. Thanks we give, and adoration
For Your gospel's joyful sound:
May the fruits of your Communion.
In our hearts and lives abound:
Ever faithful, ever faithful
To the truth may we be found.

3. So that when Your love shall call us,
Saviour, from the world away,
Let no fear of death upset us,
Glad summons to obey:
May we ever, may we ever,
In Your loving presence stay. Amen.
