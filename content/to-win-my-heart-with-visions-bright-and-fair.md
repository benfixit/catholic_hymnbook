title: To Win My Heart With Visions Bright and Fair
---

_Chorus:_
_The Cherubim, the Cherubim_
_And Seraphim, and Seraphim,_
_And heavenly hosts, that swell the glad refrain_
_In that Mary land, that Mary land._
_And mother Mary, Queen of heaven shall reign,_
_And mother Mary, Queen of heaven shall reign._

1. To win my heart with vision bright and fair.
In vain the world with all its craft has tried.
Harmless and weak its dazzling weapons are;
I nothing fear with Jesus at my side.

2. Come all ye proud ones of the earth,
Array your gathering hosts around me far and wide;
My heart is calm amid the loud affray.
I nothing fear with Jesus at my side.

3. Death hath for me no fear; its bitter pains
Shall never from my King my heart divide;
Faithful to Him till death my will remains
I nothing fear with Jesus at my side.

4. Though all the terrors of the last dread day
With death and hell together were allied;
Though Heaven and earth before me fled away
I nothing fear with Jesus at my side.

5. Jesus my Lord, my only hope and shield,
No power of ill before Thee can abide;
I trust in Thee upon the battle field
I nothing fear with Jesus at my side.
