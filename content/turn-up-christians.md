_Chorus:_
_Turn up Christians_
_Come offer your gifts to God's altar,_
_(I want to go to heaven in the morn-morning)_

1. Bring your gifts to God's altar
Offer Him gifts of bread and wine.

2. Take this bread and take this wine
Change them to Your risen self.

3. Bring your gifts to God's altar
Offer Him your gifts and your hearts.
