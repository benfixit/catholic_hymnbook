---

_Chorus:_
_Praise the Lord for God so loved the world_
_Praise the Lord He gave His only Son_
_Praise the Lord to carry sins of men_
_Praise the Lord for Jesus died for you, died for me._

1. Pilate said l've found no fault in Him.
The people said we found a fault in Him
But He went and journeyed to the Cross.
Praise the Lord for, Jesus died for you died for me.

2. It is finished said saviour on the cross,
It is finished the half on heaven melt,
It is finished for Jesus died for you,
Praise the Lord for Jesus died for you, died for you.

3. Jesus hung between heaven and earth,
Jesus bled and died upon the cross,
Just to save the soul of men from death,
Praise the Lord for Jesus died for you, died for me.

4. He has promised, to give eternal life,
Only to those who believe in His name,
If you believe, you'll have eternal life,
Praise the Lord for Jesus died for you, died for me.
