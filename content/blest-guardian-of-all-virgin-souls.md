1. Blest guardian of all virgin souls!
Portal of bliss to man forgiven!
Pure Mother of Almighty God!
Thou hope of earth, and joy of heaven!

2. Fair Lily found amid the thorns!
Most beauteous Dove with wings of gold!
Rod from whose tender root upspring
That healing Flower long since foretold.

3. Thou Tower, against the dragon proof!
Thou Star, to storm-tossed voy'gers dear!
Our course lies o'er a treach'rous deep,
Thine be the light by which we steer.

4. Scatter the mists that round us hang;
Keep far the fatal shoals away;
And while through darkling waves we sweep,
Open a path to light and day.

5. O Jesu, born of Virgin bright,
Immortal glory be to Thee;
Praise to the Father infinite
And Holy Ghost eternally.
