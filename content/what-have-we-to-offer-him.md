title: What Have We To Offer Him

---

1. What have we to offer Him
Who is God and Lord of all?
We have one true sacrifice
Jesus Christ our Lord.

2. From the Father came the Son
Crucified to save us all
This our only offering
Jesus Christ our Lord.

3. All true men are joined in Him
Who for love has saved the world.
Joined in one as God made man
Jesus Christ our Lord.

4. Father, take this offering
Take the bread and take the wine
Take the victim now prepared
Jesus Christ our Lord.
