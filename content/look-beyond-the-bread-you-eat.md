title: Look Beyond The Bread You Eat
---

_Chorus:_
_Look beyond the bread you eat;_
_See your Savior and your Lord._
_Look beyond the cup you drink;_
_See his love poured out as blood._

1. Give us a sign that we might believe in You,
Moses gave us manna from the sky.

2. I am the bread, which from the heavens came
He who eats this bread will never die.

3. The bread I give you will be my very flesh
My blood will truly be your drink

4. This man speak harshly, who can listen to His word,
We shall no longer go with Him.

5. You my disciples, will you also leave,
Lord, to whom shall we go?
