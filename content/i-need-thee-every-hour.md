_Chorus:_
_I need thee, Oh I need Thee;_
_Ev'ry hour I need Thee!_
_Oh bless me now, my Saviour;_
_I come to Thee._

1. I need Thee ev'ry hour,
Most gracious Lord.
No tender voice like thine
Can peace afford.

2. I need Thee ev'ry hour,
Stay thou near by;
Temptations lose their pow'r
When Thou art nigh.

3. I need Thee every hour
In joy or pain;
Come quickly and abide,
Or life is vain.

4. I need Thee ev'ry hour,
Teach me thy will;
Thy promises so rich
In me fulfil.

5. I need Thee ev'ry hour,
Most Holy One;
O make me Thine indeed,
Thou Blessed Son.
