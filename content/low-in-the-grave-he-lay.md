_Chorus:_
_Up from the grave He arose;_
_With a mighty triumph o'er His foes;_
_He arose a victor from the dark domain,_
_And He lives for ever with His saints to reign._
_He arose! He arose!_
_Alleluia! Christ arose._

1. Low in the grave he lay,
Jesus my Saviour!
Waiting the coming day,
Jesus my Lord!

2. Vainly they watch His bed,
Jesus my Saviour!
Vainly they seal the dead,
Jesus my Lord!

3. Death cannot keep its prey,
Jesus my Saviour!
He tore the bars away,
Jesus my Lord!
