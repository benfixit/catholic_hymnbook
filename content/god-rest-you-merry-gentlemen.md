1. God rest you mery, gentlemen,
Let nothing you dismay;
Remember Christ our Savior
Was born on Christmas day,
To save us all from Satan's pow'r
When we were gone astray.

_Chorus:_
_O tidings of comfort and joy, comfort and joy;_
_O tidings of comfort and joy!_

2. In Bethlehem in Jewry
This blessed Babe was born,
And laid within a manger
Upon this blessed morn:
The which his Mother Mary
Did nothing take in scorn:

3. From God our heav'nly Father
A blessed angel came,
And unto certain shepherds
Brought tidings of the same;
How that in Bethlehem was born
The Son of God by name:

4. The shepherds at those tidings
Rejoiced much in mind,
And left their flocks afeeding
In tempest, storm, and wind,
And went to Bethlehem straightway,
The Son of God to find:

5. Now to the Lord sing praises,
All you within this place,
And with true love and brotherhood
Each other now embrace.
This holy tide of Christmas
Doth bring redeeming grace.
