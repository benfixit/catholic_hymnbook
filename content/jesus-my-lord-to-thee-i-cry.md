title: Jesus, My Lord, to Thee I Cry
---

_Chorus:_
_And take me as I am, and take me as I am_
_My only plea—Christ died for me!_
_Oh, take me as I am._

1. Jesus, my Lord, to Thee I cry;
Unless Thou save me, I must die!
Oh, bring Thy free salvation nigh,
And take me as I am!

2. Helpless I am, and full of guilt;
But yet for me Thy blood was spilt,
And Thou canst make me what Thou wilt,
And take me as I am.

3. No preparation can I make,
My best resolves I only break,
Yet save me for Thine own name's sake,
And take me as I am.

4. Behold me, Savior, at Thy feet,
Deal with me as Thou seest meet;
Thy work begin, Thy work complete,
And take me as I am.
