title: O Splendor of God's Glory Bright
---

1. O splendor of God's glory bright,
O thou that bringest light from light,
O Light of Light, light's living spring,
O Day, all days illuminating.

2. O thou true Sun, on us thy glance
Let fall in royal radiance,
The Spirit's sanctifying beam
Upon our earthly senses stream.

3. To Father, too, our prayers implore,
Father of glory evermore;
The Father of all grade and might,
To banish sin from our delight.

4. To guide whate'er we nobly do,
With love all envy to subdue,
To make ill fortune turn to fair,
And give us grace our wrongs to bear.

5. Our mind be in his keeping placed,
Our body true to him and chaste,
Where only faith her fire shall feed
To burn the tares of Satan's seed.

6. And Christ to us for food shall be,
From him our drink that welleth free,
The Spirit's wine, that maketh whole,
And mocking not, exalts the soul.

7. Rejoicing may this day go hence,
Like virgin dawn our innocence,
Like fiery noon our faith appear,
Nor know the gloom of twilight drear.

8. Morn in her rosy car is borne:
Let him come forth our Perfect Morn,
The Word in God the Father One,
The Father perfect in the Son. Amen.
