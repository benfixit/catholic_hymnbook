title: I Cannot Come to the Banquet
---

_Chorus:_
_I can not come!_
_I cannot come to the banquet,_
_Don't trouble me now,_
_I have married a wife,_
_I have bought me a cow,_
_I have fields and commitments_
_That cost a pretty sum,_
_Pray hold me excused,_
_I cannot come._

1. A certain man had a feast,
On his fine estate in town,
He laid a festive table
And wore a wedding gown,
He sent in invitations,
To his neighbors far and wide,
But when the meal was ready,
Each one of them replied:
I cannot come.

2. The master rose up in anger,
Called his servants by name, said:
"Go into the town, fetch the blind and the lame,
Fetch the peasant and the pauper,
for this I have willed,
My banquet must be crowded,
And my table must be filled."
I cannot come.

3. When all the poor had assembled,
There still was room to spare,
So the master demanded:
"Go search everywhere,
To the highways and the byways
And force them to come in,
My table must be filled
Before the banquet can begin."
I cannot come.

4. Now God has written a lesson
For the rest of mankind,
If we're slow in responding,
He may leave us behind,
He's preparing a banquet
For that great and glorious day,
When the Lord and master calls us,
Be certain not to say:
I cannot come.
