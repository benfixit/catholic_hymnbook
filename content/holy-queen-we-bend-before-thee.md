_Chorus:_
_Teach O teach us, Holy Mother,_
_How to conquer every sin,_
_How to love and help each other_
_How the prize of life to win._

1. Holy Queen we bend before thee,
Queen of purity divine,
Make us love thee, we implore thee
Make us truly to be thine.

2. Thou to whom a child was given,
Greater than the sons of men
Coming down from highest heaven
To create the world again.

3. Oh by that Almighty Maker
Whom thyself, a virgin bore
O by the Supreme Creator
Linked with thee for evermore.

4. By the hope thy name inspires,
By our doom, reversed thru, thee
Help us Queen of Angel-Choirs,
To a blest eternity.
