title: New Praises Be Given

---

1. New praises be given
to Christ newly crowned,
Who back to his heaven
a new way hath found;
God's blessedness sharing
before us he goes,
what mansions preparing,
what endless repose.

2. His glory still praising
on thrice holy ground
The apostles stood gazing,
His mother around;
With hearts that beat faster,
With eyes full of love,
They watched while their master
ascended above.

3. "No star can disclose Him",
The bright angels said;
Eternity knows Him,
your conquering head
Those high habitations
He leaves not again,
Till, judging all nations,
on earth He shall reign.

4. Thus spoke they and straightway,
Where legions defend
Heaven's glittering gateway,
Their Lord they attend,
And cry, looking thither,
your portals let down
For Him Who rides hither
in peace and renown.
