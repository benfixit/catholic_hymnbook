title: O Food of Angels (Panis Angelicus)

---

1. O food of angels, now food for men
Communion, Christ himself, not a mere symbol
O joy wonderful the poor, the servant
And the lowly, the humble eat the Lord.
Jesus to his people, His flesh to eat, His blood to drink
Communion is Christ himself, not a mere symbol
O mystery sublime.
And the lowly, the humble eat the Lord
The poor, the servant; the lowly,the humble eat the Lord.
