title: Only-Begotten, Word of God Eternal
---

1. Only begotten, Word of God eternal,
Lord of creation, merciful and mighty;
Hear us, your servants, as our tuneful voices
Rise in your presence.

2. Holy this temple where our Lord is dwelling;
This is none other than the gate of heaven.
Ever your children, year by year rejoicing,
Chant in your temple.

3. Hear us, O Father, as we throng your temple.
By your past blessings, by your present bounty,
Smile on your children, and in grace and mercy
Hear our petition.

4. God in three persons, Father everlasting,
Son co-eternal, ever blessed Spirit:
To you be praises, thanks, and adoration,
Glory forever.
