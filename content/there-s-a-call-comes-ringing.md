_Chorus:_
_Send the light, the blessed Gospel light;_
_Let it shine from shore to shore!_
_Send the light, the blessed Gospel light;_
_Let it shine for evermore!_

1. There's a call comes ringing o'er the restless wave,
“Send the light! Send the light!”
There are souls to rescue, there are souls to save,
Send the light! Send the light!

2. We have heard the Macedonian call today,
“Send the light! Send the light!”
And our grateful off'rings at the cross we lay,
Send the light! Send the light!

3. May the grace of Jesus unto all abound,
“Send the light! Send the light!”
And a Christlike spirit everywhere be found,
Send the light! Send the light!

4. Let us not grow weary in the work of love,
“Send the light! Send the light!”
While we gather jewels for our crown above,
Send the light! Send the light!
