_Chorus:_
_“Whosoever will, whosoever will”_
_Send a proclamation over vale and hill_
_'Tis a loving Father calls the wandering home_
_“Whosoever will may come”._

1. “Whosoever heareth” shout, shout the sound!
Send the blessed tidings all the world around
Spread the joyful news wherever man is found
“Whosoever will, may come”.

2. Whosoever cometh need not delay
Now the door is open, enter while you may
Jesus is the true, the only Living Way
“Whosoever will, may come “.

3. “Whosoever will”, the promise is secure
“Whosoever will“, for ever shall endure
“Whosoever will“ 'tis life for evermore
“Whosoever will, may come”.
