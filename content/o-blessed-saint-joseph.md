1. O blessed St Joseph
how great was your worth.
The one chosen shadow of God upon earth,
Called Father of Jesus ah, then wilt thou be,
Sweet spouse of our Lady, a father to me.

2. For thou to the pilgrim are Father and guide,
And Jesus and Mary felt safe by thy side;
Ah, Blessed Saint Joseph, how safe I should be,
Sweet Spouse of our Lady
if thou were with me.

3. When the treasures of God were unsheltered on earth,
Safekeeping was found for them both in thy worth
O Father of Jesus, be father to me,
Sweet spouse of our Lady
and I will love Thee.
