_Antiphon:_
_All the earth proclaim the Lord,_
_sing your praise to God._

1. Serve you the Lord, heart filled with gladness,
Come into His presence singing for joy!

2. Know that the Lord is our creator.
Yes, He is our Father; we are his sons.

3. We are the sheep of the green pasture,
For we are His people; He is our God.

4. Enter His gates bringing thanksgiving,
O enter His courts while singing His praise.

5. Our Lord is good, His love enduring,
His word is abiding now with all men.

6. Honour and praise be to the Father,
The Son, and the Spirit, world without end.
