_Chorus:_
_Jesus for me, Jesus for me,_
_All the time everywhere,_
_Jesus for me._

1. Jesus, my Savior, is all things to me;
Oh, what a wonderful Savior is He,
Guiding, protecting, o'er life's rolling sea,
Mighty deliverer Jesus for me.

2. Jesus in sickness, and Jesus in health,
Jesus in poverty, comfort or wealth;
Sunshine or tempest, whatever it be,
He is my safety, Jesus for me.

3. He is my refuge, my rock, and my tower,
He is my treasure, my strength and my power;
Life everlasting, my days man is He,
Blessed Redeemer, Jesus for me.
