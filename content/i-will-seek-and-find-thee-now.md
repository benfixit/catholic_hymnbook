_Chorus:_
_Thou art pure and undefiled, undefiled._
_I a weak and helpless child,_
_Yet thy Word hath said to me,_
_Little ones may come to Thee,_
_Yes, the little ones may come to Thee._

1. I will seek and find Thee now,
Blessed Saviour, teach me how,
I will lay my heart to rest,
On Thy gentle loving breast.

2. Thou did'st leave Thy crown of light,
Thou did'st leave Thy home so bright,
Thou did'st leave them all for me,
That my soul might live with Thee.

3. Precious Saviour, Friend Divine,
Take and keep my hand in Thine;
Then how happy I shall be,
Step by step to walk with Thee.
