title: Heart of Jesus, We Are Grateful

---

_Chorus:_
_Heart of Jesus, we will thank thee,_
_We will love the more and more;_
_Heart of Jesus, we will praise thee,_
_And we'll thank the o'er and o'er._

1. Heart of Jesus, we are grateful
For thy answer to our prayer;
We have sought thee, ever hopeful
That thy blessings we might share;
Thou has heard us interceding,
With thy love which is untold,
And in answer to our pleading
All thy treasures dost unfold.

2. Heart of Jesus, thou hast taught us
How to seek and how to find,
And that lesson now has brought us
To thy heart so sweet and kind.
What we ask, with faith believing,
Thou hast pledged thy word to give,
And thy word is not deceiving,
But in the truth by which we live.

3. Heart of Jesus, whilst we waited
For the favors now obtained,
Not a moment had we doubted
That by prayer they'd be gained.
Thou hadst told us that our treasures
Would be found in thy dear heart.
And we knew that without measure
Thou dost all thy gifts impart.
