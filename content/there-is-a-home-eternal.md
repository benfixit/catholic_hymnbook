_Chorus:_
_Home! Beautiful Home!_
_Bright beautiful Home!_
_Bright Home of our Saviour,_
_Bright beautiful Home!_

1. There is a Home eternal,
Beautiful and bright,
Where sweet joys supernal
Never are dimmed by night;
White robed angels are singing,
Ever around the bright throne;
When, oh, when shall I see thee,
Beautiful, beautiful Home?

2. Flowers are ever springing
In that Home so fair;
Little children singing
Praises to Jesus there.
How they swell the glad anthem,
Ever around the bright throne;
When, oh, when shall I see thee,
Beautiful, beautiful Home?

3. Soon shall I join the ransomed,
Far beyond the sky;
Christ is my salvation,
Why should I fear to die?
Soon my eyes shall behold Him
Seated upon the bright throne;
Then, oh, then shall I see thee,
Beautiful, beautiful Home?
