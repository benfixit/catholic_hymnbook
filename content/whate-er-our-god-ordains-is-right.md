title: Whate'er Our God Ordains Is Right

---

1. Whate'er our God ordains is right;
Holy his will abideth;
I will be still whate'er he doth,
And follow where he guideth.
He is my God;
Though dark my road,
He holds me that I shall not fall;
Wherefore to him I leave it all.

2. Whate'er our God ordains is right;
He never will deceive me;
He leads me by the proper path;
I know he will not leave me.
I take, content,
What he hath sent;
His hand can turn my griefs away,
And patiently I wait his day.

3. Whate'er our God ordains is right;
Though now this cup, in drinking,
May bitter seem to my faint heart,
I take it, all unshrinking;
Tears pass away
With dawn of day;
Sweet comfort yet shall fill my heart,
And pain and sorrow shall depart.

4. Whate'er our God ordains is right;
Here shall my stand be taken;
Though sorrow, need, or death be mine,
Yet I am not forsaken;
My Father's care
Is round me there;
He holds me that I shall not fall,
And so to him I leave it all.
