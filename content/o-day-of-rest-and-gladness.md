title: O Day of Rest and Gladness
---

1. O day of rest and gladness,
O day of joy and light,
O balm of care and sadness,
Most beautiful, most bright
On thee, the high and lowly,
Through ages joined in tune,
Sing holy, holy, holy,
To the great God Triune.

2. On thee, at the creation,
The light first had its birth;
On thee, for our salvation,
Christ rose from depths to earth;
On thee, our Lord victorious,
The Spirit sent from heaven,
And thus on thee, most glorious,
A triple light was given.

3. Thou art a holy ladder,
Where angels go and come;
Each Sunday finds us gladder,
Nearer to heaven, our home;
A day of sweet reflection,
Thou art a day of love,
A day of resurrection
From earth to things above.

4. New graces ever gaining
From this our day of rest,
We reach the rest remaining
To spirits of the blessed.
To Holy Ghost be praises,
To Father, and to Son,
The Church her voice upraises
To thee, blessed Three in One.
