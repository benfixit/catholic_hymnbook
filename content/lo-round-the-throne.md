title: Lo! Round the Throne
---

1. Lo! Round the throne, a glorious band,
The saints in countless myriads stand,
Of every tongue redeemed to God,
Arrayed in garments washed in blood.
Alleluia!

2. Through tribulation great they came;
They bore the cross, despised the shame;
From all their labors now they rest.
In God's eternal glory blest.
Alleluia!

3. They see their Savior face to face,
And sing the triumphs of his grace;
Him day and night they ceaseless praise,
To him the loud thanksgiving raise.
Alleluia!
