_Chorus:_
_Just a closer walk with Thee,_
_Grant it, Jesus, is my plea,_
_Daily walking close to Thee,_
_Let it be, dear Lord, let it be._

1. I am weak but Thou art strong;
Jesus, keep me from all wrong;
I'll be satisfied as long as I walk,
Let me walk close to Thee.

2. Through this world of toil and snares,
If I falter, Lord, who cares?
None but Thee my burden shares?
None but Thee, dear Lord, none but Thee.

3. When my feeble life is o'er,
Time for me would be no more;
Guide me gently, safely o'er
To Thy kingdom shore, to Thy shore.
