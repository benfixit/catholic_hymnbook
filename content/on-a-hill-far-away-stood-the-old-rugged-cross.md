_Chorus:_
_So I'll cherish the old rugged cross,_
_Till my trophies at last I lay down;_
_I will cling to the old rugged cross,_
_And exchange it some day for a crown._

1. On a hill far away stood an old rugged cross,
The emblem of suff'ring and shame;
And I love that old cross
Where the dearest and best
For a world of lost sinners was slain.

2. Oh, that old rugged cross, so despised by the world,
Has a wondrous attraction for me;
For the dear Lamb of God left his glory above,
To bear it to dark Calvary.

3. In the old rugged cross, stained with blood so divine,
A wondrous beauty I see;
For 'twas on that old cross Jesus suffered and died,
To pardon and sanctify me.

4. To the old rugged cross I will ever be true,
its shame and reproach gladly bear.
Then He'll call me some day to my home far away,
Where his glory forever I'll share.
