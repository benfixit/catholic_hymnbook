title: All you who seek a comfort sure

---

1. All ye who seek a comfort sure
In trouble and distress;
Whatever sorrow vex the mind,
Or guilt the soul oppress.

_Chorus:_
_Jesus, who gave himself for you_
_Upon the cross to die;_
_Opens to you his sacred heart,_
_Oh to that heart draw nigh._

2. You hear how kindly he invites;
You hear his words so blest:
"All you that labour, come to Me,
And I will give you rest."

3. What meeker than the Saviour's heart
As on the Cross He lay?
It did His murderers forgive
And for their pardon pray.
