1. Sole hope of all the world and Lord,
Bestower of the great reward,
Receive the prayers Thy servants raise
Mixed with psalms and chants of praise.

2. And though our conscience doth proclaim,.
Our deep transgressions and our shame,
Cleanse us, O God, we humbly plead,
From sins of thought and word and deed.

3. Our sins remember Thou no more,
Forgive, Thy mercy can restore,
So take upon Thee Lord, our care,
That pure in heart we make our prayer.

4. Therefore accept, O Lord, this tide
Of fact which Thou hast sanctified,
That we may reach by mystic ways,
The sacraments of Paschal days.

5. May He who is the threefold Lord
On us confer this high reward,
In whom so long as world abide
One only God is glorified.
