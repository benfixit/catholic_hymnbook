title: Holy God, We Praise Your Name

---

1. Holy God, we praise Your name;
Lord of all, we bow before You!
All on earth Your scepter claim,
All in Heaven above adore You;
Infinite Your vast domain,
Everlasting is Your reign.

2. Hark! the loud celestial hymn
Angel choirs above are raising,
Cherubim and seraphim,
In unceasing chorus praising;
Fill the heavens with sweet accord:
Holy, holy, holy, Lord.

3. Holy Father, Holy Son,
Holy Spirit, Three we name You;
While in essence only One,
Undivided God we 'claim You;
And adoring bend the knee,
While we own the mystery.

4. Spare Your people, Lord, we pray,
By a thousand snares surrounded:
Keep us without sin today,
Never let us be confounded.
Lo, I put my trust in You;
Never, Lord, abandon me.
