_Chorus:_
_I will, I will, I will,_
_God helping me, I will,_
_O Lord, be Thine._
_Thy precious blood was shed to purchase me_
_I will be wholly Thine._

1. Once more, my soul,
Thy Saviour, thro' the Word,
Is offered full and free;
And now, O Lord, I must, I must decide:
Shall I accept of Thee?

2. By grace I will Thy mercy now receive,
Thy love my heart hath won;
On Thee, O Christ,
I will, I will believe,
And trust in Thee alone.

3. Thou knowest, Lord, how very weak I am,
And how I fear to stray;
For strength to serve,
I look to Thee alone
The strength Thou must supply.
