1. Fields full of flowers and woods full of pine,
And the waters clear and blue.
Every bird who is winging thru' the sky overhead
Lifts our hearts to thoughts of you God of hosts,
They lift our hearts to you.

_Chorus:_
_All of the heavens and all of the earth_
_Will praise the Holy of Holies._

2. Who will go up to the mountain of God?
Who will see his holy place?
Every man who is pure of heart
And set in the right.
They will see the holy face of the Lord
They'll see His holy face.

3. Lift up your heads, O ye ancient doors.
Open up, ye gates and right
For the Lord who is God of all
Has come to your doors,
Let us sing of glory, sing to the Lord
O Lord of Hosts, Our King.
