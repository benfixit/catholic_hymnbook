_Chorus:_
_Here we are, altogether as we sing our song joyfully;_
_Here we are, altogether as we pray we always be._

1. Join we now as friends, and celebrate
The brotherhood we share, all as one.
Keep the fire burning, kindle it with care,
And we'll all join in and sing.

2. Let us make the world an alleluia.
Let us make the world a better place.
Keep a smile handy, have a helping hand,
Let us all join in and sing.
