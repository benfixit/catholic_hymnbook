title: God Our Father Forgive Our Sins

---

1. God our Father, forgive our sins,
For we are very weak,
God our Father, we hope in Thee
Throughout our lives.

_Chorus:_
_Remember the Lord,_
_The King of earth,_
_And of the sea,_
_Of heaven above._

2. Lord, show us Thy way,
To do according to Thy will.
Lord, show us Thy way,
To be ever worthh love of Thee.

3. Christ our Redeemer,
We pray to love, to save Thy children;
Christ our Redeemer to be our tongue,
To our heavenly King.

4. Let us be righteous in Communion,
As Body of Christ,
Let us be righteous to overcome,
The devil's work.

5. Wash away our sins with Thy tongue,
And precious blood,
Wash away our sins,
To save us from the death of hell.

6. Mary our Mother pray for us thy children,
On earth,
Mary our Mother,
Give us on earth a mother's care.
