title: By the Blood That Flowed From Thee

---

_Chorus:_
_Jesus, Savior, hear our cry;_
_Thou wert suff'ring once as we;_
_Hear the loving Litany_
_We thy children sing to thee._

1. By the blood that flowed from thee
In thy bitter agony;
By the scourge so meekly borne;
By thy purple robe of scorn,

2. By the thorns that crowned thy head;
By thy scepter of a reed;
By thy footstep faint and slow,
Weighed beneath thy Cross of woe,

3. By the nails and pointed spear;
By thy people's cruel jeer;
By thy dying prayer which rose
Begging mercy for thy foes.

4. By the darkness thick as night
Blotting out the sun from sight;
By the cry with which in death
Thou didst yield thy parting breath.

5. By the weeping Mother's woe;
By the sword that pierced her through,
When, in anguish standing by,
On the Cross she saw thee die.
