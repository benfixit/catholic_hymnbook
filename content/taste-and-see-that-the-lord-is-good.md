_Chorus:_
_Taste and see that the Lord is good!_
_Happy is the man who trusts in him!_

1. Sing to the Lord with me.
In chorus let us praise his name.
Look to him and be filled with joy,
For the Lord's blessings come over his people.

2. Listen, my friends to me,
If you would have eternal life,
Turn from evil, see joy and peace,
For the Lord looks with favour on all just men.

3. Call on the Lord in grief.
For he is near the crushed of heart.
Many troubles oppress the just,
But the Lord saves his people from all evil.
