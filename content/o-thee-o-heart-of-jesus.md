title: O Thee, O Heart of Jesus

---

_Chorus:_
_Yes, yes till life is o'er,_
_And then for evermore,_
_O Sacred Heart of Jesus,_
_We'll love Thee and adore._

1. To Thee, O Heart of Jesus,
To Thee our hearts we give,
Help, help us all to love Thee,
And serve Thee while we live.

2. No heart can be so tender,
No heart can love like Thee:
Thy life's blood all, O Jesus,
Was shed to set us free.
