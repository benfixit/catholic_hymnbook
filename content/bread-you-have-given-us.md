_Refrain:_
_Bread you have given us,_
_Lord, that we may see;_
_Wine You have shared with us,_
_Lord, that we may see;_
_Your heart and Your flesh_
_Are forever one with us,_
_Lord that we may see,_
_Lord that we may see._

1. We come to sing at the table of love,
We come to sing at the table of love,
We come to sing all the songs we know
To bring our love, to bring our love.

2. We come to laugh at the table of love,
We come to laugh at the table of love,
We come to laugh all the joy we know
To bring our love, to bring our love.

3. We come to die at the table of love,
We come to die at the table of love,
We come to die all the death we know
To bring our love, to bring our love.

4. We come to be at the table of love,
We come to be at the table of love,
We come to be all the life we know,
To bring our love, to bring our love.

5. I come with you to the table of love,
I come with you to the table of love,
I come with you whom I long to know,
To bring our love, to bring our love.
