1. "Take up your cross," the Savior said,
"If you would my disciple be;
Take up your cross with willing heart,
And humbly follow after me."

2. Take up your cross, let not its weight
Fill your weak spirit with alarm;
Christ's strength shall bear your spirit up,
And brace your heart, and nerve your arm.

3. Take up your cross, head not the shame,
And let your foolish heart be still;
The Lord for you accepted death
Upon the cross, on Calv'ry's hill.

4. Take up your cross, then, in Christ's strength,
And calmly ev'ry danger brave:
It guides you to abundant life
And leads to vict'ry o'er the grave.

5. Take up your cross, and follow Christ,
Nor think till death to lay it down;
For only those who bear the cross
May hope to wear the glorious crown.
