_Chorus:_
_“You are my people, I am your God_
_You are my people, close to my heart”._

1. Lord, we are thirsty, walkin' thro' this desert land
Lord, we are thirsty, give us to drink!
The Lord sent water from the rock
To give His people to drink.

2. Lord, we are hungry, walkin' thro' this desert land!
Lord, we  are hungry, give us some food
The Lord sent manna from the sky
To give His people food.

3. Lord, we are weary, lost in this desert land
Lord, we are weary, show us the way!
The Lord sent a pillar of cloud by day
A pillar of fire by night, to show His people the way.

4. Still they cried out, and they complained
“Where is the Savior, the anointed one?”
The Lord sent His only Son
Christ, the anointed.

5. I give you my body to be your food
My blood I pour out that you may never thirst
I give you my light: I give you my love
I give you my Spirit of love.
