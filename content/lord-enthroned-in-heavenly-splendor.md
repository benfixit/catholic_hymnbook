title: Lord, Enthroned in Heavenly Splendor

1. Lord, enthroned in heav'nly splendor,
First begotten from the dead,
Thou alone, our strong defender,
Liftest up thy people's head.
Alleluia, alleluia,
Jesu, true and living bread.

2. Here our humblest homage pay we,
Here in loving rev'rence blow;
Here for faith's discernment pray we,
Lest we fail to know thee now.
Alleluia, alleluia,
Thou art here, we ask not how.

3. Through the lowliest form doth veil thee
As of old in Bethlehem,
Here as there thine angels hail thee,
Branch and Flow'r of Jesse's Stem.
Alleluia, alleluia,
We in worship join with them.

4. Paschal Lamb, thine off 'ring, finished
Once for all when thou wast slain,
In its fullness undiminished
Shall for evermore remain.
Alleluia, alleluia,
Cleansing souls from ev'ry stain.

5. Life-imparting heav'nly manna,
Stricken rock with streaming side,
Heav'n and earth with loud hosanna
Worship thee, the Lamb who died.
Alleluia, alleluia,
Ris'n, ascended, glorified!
