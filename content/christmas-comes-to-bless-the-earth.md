title: Christmas Comes to Bless the Earth
---

1. Christmas comes to bless the earth,
With its wondrous heavenly birth,
Bright and high the dawning light
Burning through the gloom of night.

2. God hath come with us to dwell,
In this message, hard to tell,
God the Son, the one Divine,
Sent below from heaven Thine.

3. Glory to the Father be,
Sing the angels all to Thee.
Father, Son and Holy Ghost,
All in one our praises most.
