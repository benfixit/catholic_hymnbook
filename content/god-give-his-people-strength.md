title: God Give His People Strength

---

1. God gives His people strength.
If we believe in His way.
He's swift to repay
All those who bear the burden of the day.
God gives His people strength.

2. God gives His people hope.
If we but trust in His word,
Our prayers are always heard.
He warmly welcomes anyone who's erred.
God gives His people hope.

3. God gives His people love.
If we but open wide our heart,
He's sure to do His part;
He's always the first to make a start.
God gives His people love.

4. God gives His people peace.
When sorrow fills us to the brim,
And courage grows dim,
He lays to rest our restlessness in Him.
God gives His people peace.
