_Chorus:_
_Come Lord Jesus, the light is dying,_
_The night keeps crying,_
_Come Lord Jesus._

1. Christ, come quickly,
There's danger at the door,
Poverty a-plenty
Hearts gone wild with war,
There's hunger in the city
And famine on the plain.

2. Want demands a hearing,
In far too many lands,
The sick go unattended,
Death deals a heavy hand
The dreams of all are empty,
Their cup of sorrow full.

3. The world awaits in darkness
A mighty burst of light,
To set the lame man leaping,
To give the blind man sight,
We have the prophets' promise.
We await the Prince of peace.

4. The clouds shall send a Saviour
Like softly falling rain,
Yet mighty in his power,
To free us from our chains.
His shield will be compassion,
His weapon liberty.
