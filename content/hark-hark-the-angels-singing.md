title: Hark! Hark the Angels Singing
---

1. Hark, hark, the Angels singing,
Through all the heavenly coast,
'Tis Holy, Holy, Holy,
And Thou Lord God of Host.
The starry skies aroun us,
The shining earth below,
The greatness of Thy glory,
In bright effulgence shows.

2. Then, children join your voices,
And sing with one accord,
Thrice Blessed He who cometh,
In Thy name, mighty Lord,
Hosanna in the Highest,
Hosanna David's Son.
Thus may we sing in glory,
Forever round His throne.
