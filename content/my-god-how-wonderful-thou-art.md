title: My God, How Wonderful Thou Art
---

1. My God, how wonderful Thou art,
Thy majesty, how bright,
How beautiful Thy mercy seat
In depths of burning light!

2. How dread are Thine eternal years,
O everlasting Lord!
By prostrate spirits day and night
Incessantly adored!

3. How beautiful, how beautiful,
The sight of Thee must be,
Thine endless wisdom, boundless power,
And awful purity!

4. Oh, how I fear Thee, living God!
With deepest, tenderest fears,
And worship Thee with trembling hope,
And penitential tears.

5. Yet I may love Thee too, O Lord!
Almighty as Thou art,
For Thou hast stooped to ask of me
The love of my poor heart.

6. No earthly father loves like Thee,
No mother e'er so mild,
Bears and forbears, as Thou hast done,
With me Thy sinful child.
