title: Hear Us O Lord (Attende Domine)

_Chorus:_
_Hear us, O Lord, and have mercy upon us,_
_For we have sinned against Thee._

1. King high exalted, all the world's redeemer'
To Thee Thy children lift their eyes with weeping;
Christ, we implore Thee, hear our supplications.

2. Right hand of Godhead, headstone of the corner,
Path of salvation, gate of heaven's kingdom,
Cleanse Thou Thy people, stained with their transgressions.

3. We, Thy eternal majesty entreating,
Make lamentation in Thy holy hearing;
Graciously, grant Thou to our sins indulgence.

4. Humbly confess we, who have sinned against Thee,
All our misdoings, hidden now no longer,
May Thy redeeming mercy find us pardon.

5. Led away captive, guiltless, unresisting,
Brought by false witness unto death for sinners,
Christ do Thou keep us whom Thy blood hath ransomed.
