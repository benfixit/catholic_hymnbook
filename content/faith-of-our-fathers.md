_Chorus:_
_Faith of our fathers, holy faith!_
_We will be true to thee till death._

1. Faith of our fathers, living still,
In spite of dungeon, fire and sword;
O how our hearts beat high with joy,
Whene'er we hear that glorios word:

2. Our fathers, chained in prisons dark,
Were still in heart and conscience free;
And blest would be their children's fate
If we, like them, should die for thee.

3. Faith of our fathers, Mary's prayers
Shall win all nations unto thee;
And through the truth that comes from God,
Mankind shall then indeed be free.

4. Faith of our fathers, we will love
Both friend and foe in all our strife;
And preach thee, too, as love knows how
By kindly deeds and virtuous life.
