1. In his temple now behold him,
See the long expected Lord;
Ancient prophets had fortold him;
God has now fulfilled his word,
Now, to praise him, his redeemèd
Shall break forth with one accord.

2. In the arms of her who bore him,
Virgin pure, behold him lie,
While his aged saints adore him
Ere in faith and hope they die.
Alleluia! Alleluia!
Lo, the Incarnate God most high.

3. Jesus, by your presentation,
When thy blest you, weak and poor,
Make us see our great salvation,
Seal us with your promise sure,
And present us in your glory
To your Father, cleansed and pure.

4. Prince and author of salvation,
Be your boundless love our theme!
Jesus, praise to you be given,
By thy world you did redeem,
With the Father and the Spirit,
Lord of majesty supreme.
