title: The Spirit Lives to Set Us Free
---

_Chorus:_
_Walk in the light,_
_Walk in the light,_
_Walk in the light,_
_Walking in the light of the Lord_

1. The Spirit lives to set us free,
Walk, walk in the light.
He binds us all in unity,
Walk, walk in the light.

2. Jesus promised life to all,
Walk, walk in the light.
The dead were wakened by his call,
Walk, walk in the light.

3. He died in pain on Calvary,
Walk, walk in the light,
To save the lost like you and me,
Walk, walk in the light.

4. We know his death is not the end,
Walk, walk in the light.
To save the lost like you and me,
Walk, walk in the light.

5. By Jesus' death our wounds are healed,
Walk, walk in the light.
The Father's kindness is revealed,
Walk, walk in the light.

6. The Spirit lives in you and me,
Walk, walk in the light.
His light will shine for all to see,
Walk, walk in the light.
