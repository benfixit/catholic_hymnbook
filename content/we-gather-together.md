title: We Gather Together

---

1. We gather together
To sing the Lord's praises
To worship the Father
Through Jesus His Son
In this celebration
All sing with jubilation
We are His holy people
Whose freedom He won.

2. We greet our Lord present
Within our assembly
We hear His good news
Announced clearly to all
Our priest is presiding
In Christ we are abiding
As we invoke God's blessing
And answer His call.

3. Since Christ is the vine
And His people the branches
In Him we give praise
To the Father above
He brings every nation
To learn of His salvation
That all may grow in knowledge
In faith, hope and love.
