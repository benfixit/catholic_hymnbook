title: Holy God, We Praise Thy Name

---

1. Holy God, we praise thy name;
Lord of all, we bow before thee!
All on earth thy scepter claim,
All in heav'n above adore thee;
Infinite thy vast domain,
Everlasting is thy reign.
Infinite thy vast domain,
Everlasting is thy reign.

2. Hark! The loud celestial hymn
Angel choirs above are raising,
Cherubim and seraphim,
In unceasing chorus praising;
Fill the heav'ns with sweet accord:
"Holy, Holy, holy Lord."
Fill the heav'ns with sweet accord:
"Holy, Holy, holy Lord."

3. Holy Father, Holy Son,
Holy Spirit, Thee we name thee;
While in essence only ONe,
Undivided God we claim thee:
And adoring, bend the knee,
While we own the mystery.
And adoring, bend the knee,
While we own the mystery.
