category: entrance

1. My God, accept my heart this day,
And make it always thine,
That I from thee no more may stray,
No more from thee decline.

2. Before the cross of him who died,
Behold I prostrate fall;
Let ev'ry sin be crucified,
Let Christ be all in all.

3. Anoint me with thy heav'nly grace,
Adopt me for thine own,
That I may see thy glorious face
And worship at thy throne.

4. May the dear blood, once shed for me,
My best atonement prove;
That I from first to last may be
The purchase of thy love!

5. Let every thought, and work, and word,
To thee be ever giv'n
Then life shall be thy service, Lord,
And death the gate of heaven!
