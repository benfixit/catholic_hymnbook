title: Come Let Us Sing Songs of Glory
---

1. Come, let us sing songs of glory,
Let us clap our hands and shout for joy.
From day to day God will show the way.

_Chorus:_
_Glory! sing glory! Glory_
_Give the glory due and sing:_
_Glory unto God the King._

2. God is our King and our Father;
He's a mighty God and King of Kings.
He filled the seas, and He made the trees.

3. Ours is the joy of His people;
We can walk in safety at His side
In stormy night He will give us light.

4. Let us remain ever faithful,
Let us always know that He is near,
Light from above, teaching us to love.
