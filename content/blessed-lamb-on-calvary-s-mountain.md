1. Blessed Lamb! on Calvary's mountain
Slain to take our sins away:
Let the drops of that rich fountain
Our tremendous ransom pay:
Sacred Saviour! Sacred Saviour!
Lowly at Thy feet we pray!

2. Blessed Lamb! — vouch
safe us pardon,
In Thy love our souls confide:
By Thy groans within the Garden,
By the death which Thou hast died.
Let Thy Passion — Let Thy Passion,
Evermore with us abide!

3. So shall peace, sweet peace be given,
Purchase of Thy precious pain;
So shall earth but lead to heaven,
Since for us the Lamb was slain:
Dear Redeemer! Dear Redeemer!
Thou canst not have died in vain.
