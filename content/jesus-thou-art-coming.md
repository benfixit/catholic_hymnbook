title: Jesus, Thou Art Coming

---

1. Jesus, thou art coming,
Holy as thou art,
Thou, the God who made me,
To my sinful heart.
Jesus, I believe it
On thy only word;
Kneeling, I adore thee
As my King and Lord

2. Who am I, my Jesus,
That thou com'st to me?
I have sinned against thee,
Often, grievously;
I am very sorry
I have caused thee pain;
I will never, never,
Wound thy heart again.

3. Put thy kind arms round me,
Feeble as I am;
Thou art my Good Shepherd,
I, the little lamb;
Since thou comest, Jesus,
Now to be my Guest,
I can trust thee always,
Lord, for all the rest.

4. Dearest Lord, I love thee,
With my whole, whole heart,
Not for what thou givest,
But for what thou art.
Come, oh, come, sweet Savior!
Come to me, and stay,
For I want thee, Jesus,
More than I can say.

5. Ah! what gift or present,
Jesus, can I bring?
I have nothing worthy
Of my God and King;
But thou art my Shepherd,
I, thy little lamb;
Take myself, dear Jesus,
All I have and am.

6. Take my body, Jesus,
Eyes, and ears, and tongue;
Never let them, Jesus,
Help to do thee wrong.
Take my heart, and fill it
Full of love for thee;
All I have I give thee,
Give thyself to me.
