_Chorus:_
_I want to sing, I want to shout Your praise, O Lord!_

1. Awake and sing my soul;
Awake and play, my harp and zither!
Let the dawning day join in praise.
My heart is ready to praise You, O Lord;
To bless You, God of my salvation, alleluial!

2. For great and wonderful Your glory, my God;
Your name is great above the heavens, alleluia
Lord, Your mercy over-shadows the earth;
Your glory lights the firmament on high, Alleluia.
