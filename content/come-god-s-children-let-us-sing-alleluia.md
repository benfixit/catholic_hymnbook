1. Come God's children let us sing, Alleluia,
Bringing gifts to praise our king, Alleluia.
Drawing close in heart and mind, Alleluia,
That by his aid the truth we'll find, Alleluia.

2. We offer gift of bread and wine, Alleluia,
In Christ our Lord, the Son divine, Alleluia.
In joyful song our voices raise, Alleluia,
To God above we offer praise, Alleluia.

3. We must love Him with all our heart, Alleluia,
As a whole and not a part, Alleluia.
Come God's children let us sing, Alleluia,
Bringing gifts to praise our king, Alleluia.
