1. Praise God of Abraham
The heavenly King
who with love abideth in eternity,
My hymn O Lord is high,
Heaven and earth praise Thee:
I will always exalt Thy Holy Name.

2. Praise God of Abraham,
giver of all blessings
Who to seek joy at His right hand,
Hath exalted man:
I loath all worldly cares,
That may draw me away from Thee:
Knowledge and strength and fear
Will be my key steps to God.

3. O God who lives on high,
There all the angels praise:
Saying holy, holy, holy, almighty King"
Thou who sitteth on the throne,
Shall reign for ever more,
My hymns of praise is great
O Lord, we worship Thee.

4. All the heavenly powers
glorify and praise Thee,
The Father, Son and Holy Spirit for ever more:
With the heavenly choir
I will thank my Lord and God:
For Kingdom, Power and Glory
Are Thine now and ever more. Amen.
