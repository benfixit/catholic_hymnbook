title: Humbly We Adore Thee

---

_Chorus:_
_Christ, our God and brother,_
_Hear our humble plea;_
_By this holy banquet_
_Keep us joined to Thee._

1. Humbly we adore Thee,
Christ, Redeemer, King;
Thou art Lord of Heaven,
Thou to whom we sing.

2. God, the Mighty, Thou has come,
Bearing gifts of grace;
Son of Adam, still Thou art
Saviour to our race.

3. Jesus, Lord, we thank Thee
For this wondrous bread;
In our land Thou dwellest,
By Thee we are fed.

4. We who share this mystery
In Thee are made one;
Ev'ry act we offer Thee
In Thy name is done.

5. Thou who died to save us
Live on as our light;
Though our eyes are blinded,
Yet our faith gives sight.

6. Christ, do Thou be merciful,
Lamb for sinners slain,
We in grief confess our guilt;
Cleanse our souls of stain.
