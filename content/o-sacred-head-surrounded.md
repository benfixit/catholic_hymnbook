1. O Sacred Head, surrounded,
By crown of piercing thorn!
O bleeding Head, so wounded,
Reviled and put to scorn!
Death's pallid hue comes o'er thee,
The glow of life decays,
Yet angel hosts adore thee,
And tremble as they gaze.

2. I see thy strength and vigor
All fading in the strife,
And death with cruel rigor,
Bereaving thee of life;
O agony and dying!
O love to sinners free!
Jesus, all grace supplying,
O turn thy face on me.

3. In this, thy bitter passion,
Good Shepherd, think of me
With thy most sweet compassion,
Unworthy though I be;
Beneath thy cross abiding
Forever would I rest,
In thy dear love confiding,
And with thy presence blest.
