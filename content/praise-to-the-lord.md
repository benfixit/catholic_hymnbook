title: Praise to the Lord

---

1. Praise to the Lord, the Almighty, the King of creation;
O my soul praise him, for he is thy health and salvation.
All ye who hear,
Now to his altar draw near,
Joining in glad adoration.

2. Praise to the Lord, who doth prosper thy work and defend thee;
Surely his goodness and mercy here daily attain thee,
Ponder anew
What the Almighty can do,
Who with his love doth befriend thee.

3. Praise to the Lord, who o'er all things so wondrously reigneth,
Shelters thee under his wings, yea, so gently sustaineth.
Has thou not seen
All that is needful hath been
Granted in what he ordaineth?

4. Praise to the Lord, O let all that is in me adore him!
All that hath life and breath come now with praises before him!
Let the Amen
Sound from his people again,
Now as we worship before him.
