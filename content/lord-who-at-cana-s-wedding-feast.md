title: Lord, Who at Cana's Wedding Feast

---

1. Lord, who at Cana's wedding feast
Didst as a guest appear,
Thou, dearer far than earthly guest,
Vouchsafe thy presence here;
For holy thou indeed dost prove
The marriage vow to be,
Proclaiming it a type of love
Between the church and thee. Amen.

2. The holiest vow that man can make,
The golden thread in life,
the bond that none may dare to break,
That bindeth man and wife;
Which blest by thee, whate'er betides,
No evil shall destroy,
Through care-won days each care divides,
And doubles ev'ry joy. Amen.

3. On those who at thine altar kneel,
O Lord, thy blessing pour,
That each may wake the other's zeal
To love thee more and more:
O grant them here in peace to live,
In purity and love,
And, this world leaving, to receive
A crown of life above! Amen.
