title: Let Thy Blood in Mercy Poured

---

_Chorus:_
_Thou didst give thyself for me,_
_Now I give myself to thee._

1. Let thy blood in mercy poured,
Let thy gracious body broken,
Be to me, O gracious Lord,
Of thy boundless love the token.

2. Thou didst die that I might live;
Blessèd Lord, thou cam'st to save me;
All that love of God could give,
Jesus by his sorrows gave me.

3. By the thorns that crowned thy brow,
By the spear-wound and the nailing,
By the pain and death, I now
Claim, O Christ, thy love unfailing.

4. Wilt thou own the gift I bring?
All my penitence I give thee;
Thou art my exalted King,
Of thy matchelss love forgive me.
