title: O King of Kings

_Chorus:_
_Our Holy Father shielding,_
_His enemies o'erthrow;_
_May Peter's faith unyielding,_
_The path to heaven foreshew._

1. O King of kings,
In splendour of glory throned on high,
Do Thou, our strong defender,
Thy Church still magnify

2. That citadel surrounding,
The angry foreman raves;
Upon that rock resounding,
Dash high the sullen waves.

3. Yet Lord, in siege laborious,
Though hell itself should rage,
Thou wondrous, Thou victorious,
Art known from age to age.

4. We trust Thy conquering power,
Now and in time to be,
The gift of peace to shower,
On those who trust in Thee.

5. Still, still with light supernal,
Those battlement shall gleam,
And Peter's rock, eternal,
Confront the restless stream.
