title: From Every Stormy Wind that Blows
---

1. From every stormy wind that blows,
From every swelling tide of woes,
There is a calm, a sure retreat;
'Tis found beneath the mercy-seat.

2. There is a place where Jesus sheds
The oil of gladness on our heads,
A place than all besides more sweet;
It is the blood-stained mercy-seat.

3. There is a scene where spirits blend,
Where friend holds fellowship with friend,
Though sundered far, by faith they meet,
Around one common mercy-seat.

4. There, there, on eagle's wings we soar,
And sense and sin molest no more;
And heaven comes down our souls to greet,
And glory crowns the mercy-seat.

5. Oh, let my hand be cold, and still,
My tongue be silent, cold and still,
This pounding heart forget to beat,
If I forget the mercy-seat.
