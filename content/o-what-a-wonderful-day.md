title: O What A Wonderful Day

---

_Chorus:_
_Heaven came down and glory filled my soul,_
_When at the cross the Saviour made me whole;_
_My sins were washed away,_
_And my night was turned to day,_
_Heaven came down and glory filled my soul._

1. O what a wonderful, wonderful day,
Day I will never forget;
After I'd wandered in darkness away,
Jesus my Savior I met.
O what a tender, compassionate friend,
He met the need of my heart;
Shadows dispelling, with joy I am telling,
He made all the darkness depart.

2. Born of the Spirit with life from above
into God's family divine,
Justified fully thru Calvary's love,
O what a standing is mine!
And the transaction so quickly was made,
when as a sinner I came,
Took of the offer, of grace He did proffer,
He saved me, O praise His dear name!

3. Now I've a hope that will surely endure
After the passing of time;
I have a future in heaven for sure
There in those mansions sublime.
And it's because of that wonderful day,
When at the cross I believed;
Riches eternal and blessings supernal,
From His precious hand I received.
