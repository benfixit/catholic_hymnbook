title: Yes I Shall Arise and Return to My Father

---

_Chorus:_
_Yes, I shall arise and return to my father._

1. To You, O Lord, I lift up  my soul
In You, O my God, I place all my trust.

2. Look down on me, have mercy, O Lord
Forgive me my sins, behold all my grief.

3. My heart and soul, shall yearn for Your face
Be gracious to me and answer my plea.

4. Do not withhold Your goodness from me
O Lord, may Your love be deep in my soul.

5. To You I pray, have pity on me
My God, I have sinned against Your great love.

6. Mercy I cry, O Lord, wash me clean
And whiter than snow my spirit shall be.

7. Give me again the joy of Your help
Now open my lips, Your praise I will sing.

8. Happy is he forgiven by God
His sins blotted out, his guilt is no more.

9. You are my joy, my refuge and strength
Let all upright hearts give praise to the Lord.

10. My soul will sing, my heart will rejoice
The blessing of God will fill all my days.
