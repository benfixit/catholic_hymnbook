title: Word of God to Earth Descending

---

1. Word of God to earch descending,
With the Father present still,
Near his earthly journey's ending
Hastes his mission to fulfill.

2. Well the traitor's kiss forknowing,
Miracle of love divine,
See his hands himself bestowing
Hastes his mission to fulfil.

3. Holy body, blood all precious,
Giv'n by him to be our food,
With them both he doth refresh us,
Formed like him of flesh and blood.

4. Mighty Victim, earth's salvation,
Heav'n's own gate unfolding wide,
Help thy people in temptation,
Feed them from thy bleeding side.

5. Unto thee, the hidden manna,
Father, Spirit, unto thee,
Let us raise the loud hosanna,
And adoring bend the knee.
