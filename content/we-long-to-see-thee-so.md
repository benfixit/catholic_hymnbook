title: We Long to See Thee So

---

_Chorus:_
_O come, O come, O come_
_Our Savior dear to be_
_O come, O come, O come_
_We have no King but Thee._

1. We long to see Thee so
To see the newly Born
We long for Christmas morn
The sands of time run slow.

2. We long to see Thee so
To see the angels glory
To hear their midnight story
And with the shepherds go.

3. We long to see Thee so
No other joys can please us
We want Thee Baby Jesus
The sands of time run slow.
