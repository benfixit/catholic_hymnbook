title: At the Cross Her Station Keeping

---

1. At the cross her station keeping,
Stood the mournful mother weeping,
Close to Jesus to the last.

2. Through her heart, his sorrow sharing,
All his bitter anguish bearing,
Now at length the sword has passed.

3. Oh, how sad and sore distressed
Was that mother highly blest
Of the sole begotten One!

4. Christ above in torment hangs;
She beneath beholds the pangs
Of her dying glorious Son.

5. Is there one who wold not weep,
Whelmed in miseries so deep
Christ's dear Mother to behold?

6. Can the human heart refrain
From partaking in her pain.
In that Mother's pain untold?

7. Bruised, derided, cursed, defiled,
She beheld her tender Child
All with bloody scourges rent;

8. For the sins of his own nation,
Saw him hang in desolation,
Till his Spirit forth he sent.

9. Make me feel as thou has felt;
Make my soul to glow and melt
With the love of Christ my Lord.

10. Holy Mother! pierce me through;
In my heart each wound renew
Of my Savior crucified;

11. Let me share with thee his pain,
Who for all my sins was slain,
Who for me in torment died.

12. Let me mingle tears with thee,
Mourning him who mourned for me,
All the days that I may live;

13. By the Cross with thee to stay;
There with thee to weep and pray;
Is all I ask thee to give.

14. Virgin of all virgins blest!
Listen to my fond request;
Let me share thy grief divine.

15. Let me, to my latest breath,
In my body bear the death
Of that dying Son of thine.

16. Wounded with his ev'ry wound,
Steep my soul till it hath swooned
In his very blood away.

17. Be to me, O Virgin, nigh,
Lest in flames I burn and die
In that awful Judgement day.

18. Christ, when thou shalt call me hence,
Be thy Mother my defence,
Be thy Cross my victory;

19. While my body here decays,
May my soul thy goodness praise,
Safe in Paradise with thee. Amen.
