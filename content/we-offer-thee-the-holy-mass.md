title: We Offer Thee the Holy Mass
---

1. We offer Thee the Holy Mass
Thee our creator to adore
To thank Thee for Thy gracious gifts
And praise Thy Name for evermore.

2. Now Jesus Christ, Thy flesh and blood
Will be our sacrifice Divine
The same in Mass as on the Cross
Though under forms of Bread and Wine

3. We pray for pardon and for grace
To change the lives that we have led
And beg Thee for Thy Son's dear sake
To bless the living and the dead.
