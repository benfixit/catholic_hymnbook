1. The Mass is ended, all go in peace,
We must diminish and Christ increase.
We take him with us wherever we go,
That through our actions his life may show.

2. We witness his love to everyone
by our communion with Christ the Son.
We take the Mass to where one may be,
so Christ may shine forth for all to see.

3. Thanks to the Father who shows the way.
His life within us throughout each day.
Let all our living and loving be
to praise and honour the Trinity.
