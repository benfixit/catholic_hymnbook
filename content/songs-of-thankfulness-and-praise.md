1. Songs of thankfulness and praise,
Jesus, Lord, to thee we raise,
Manifested by the star
To the sages from afar;
Branch of royal David's stem
In thy birth at Bethlehem;
Anthems be to thee addressed,
God in man made manifest.

2. Manifest at Jordan's stream,
Prophet, Priest, and King supreme;
And, at Cana, wedding guest
In thy Godhead manifest;
Manifest in pow'r divine,
Changing water into wine;
Anthems be to thee addressed,
God in man made manifest.

3. Manifest in making whole
Palsied limbs and fainting soul;
Manifest in valiant fight,
Quelling all the devil's might;
Manifest in gracious will,
Ever bringing good from ill;
Anthems be to thee addressed,
God in man made manifest.

4. Grant us grace to see thee, Lord,
Mirrored in thy holy word;
May we imitate thee now,
And be pure, as pure art thou;
That we like to thee may be
At thy great epiphany;
And may praise thee, ever blest,
God in man made manifest.
