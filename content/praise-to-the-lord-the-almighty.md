title: Praise to the Lord the Almighty

1. Praise to the Lord,
the Almighty, the King of creation!
O my soul, praise Him,
for He is thy health and salvation!
All you who hear,
now to His altar draw near;
Join in profound adoration.

2. Praise to the Lord,
let us offer our gifts at his Altar.
Let not our sins and transgressions
now cause us to falter.
Christ the high priest
bids us all join in His feast
Victims with Him on the altar.

3. Praise to the Lord,
O let all that is in us adore him.
All that has life
and breath comes now
rejoicing before Him.
Let the Amen sound from His people again.
As we here worship before Him.
