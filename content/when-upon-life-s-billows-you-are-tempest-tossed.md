title: When Upon Life's Billows You Are Tempest Tossed
---

_Chorus:_
_Count your blessings, name them one by one_
_Count your blessings, see what God hath done_
_Count your blessings, name them one by one_
_And it will surprise you what the Lord hath done._

1. When upon life's billows you are tempest tossed
When you are discouraged thinking all is lost
Count your many blessings, name them one by one
And it will surprise you what the Lord hath done.

2. Are you ever burdened with a load of care?
Does the cross seem heavy you are called to bear
Count your many blessings, every doubt will fly
And you will be singing as the days go by.

3. When you look at others with their lands and gold
Think that Christ has promised you His wealth untold
Count your many blessings, money cannot buy
Your reward in heaven, nor your home on high.

4. So, amid the conflict, whether great or small
Do not be discouraged, God is over all
Count your many blessings, angels will attend
Help and comfort give you to your journey's end.
