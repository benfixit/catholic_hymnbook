title: I Sing the Mighty Power of God
---

1. I sing the mighty pow'r of God,
That made the mountains rise;
That spread the flowing seas abroad,
And built the lofty skies.
I sing the Wisdom that ordained
The sun to rule the day;
The moon shines full at his command,
And all the stars obey.

2. I sing the goodness of the Lord,
That filled the earth with food;
He formed the creatures with his word,
And then pronounced them good.
Lord, how thy wonders are displayed,
Whene'er I turn my eye;
If I survey the ground I tread,
Or gaze upon the sky.

3. There's not a plant or flow'r below
But makes thy glories known;
And clouds arise, and tempests blow,
By order from thy throne;
While all that borrows life from thee
Is ever in thy care,
And ev'rywhere that man can be,
Thou, God art present there.
