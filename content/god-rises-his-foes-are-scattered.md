title: God Rises, His Foes are Scattered
category: entrance

1. God rises, his foes are scattered
And all who hate Him must flee away
They melt like wax and fire,
But all the just can dance and say.

2. Sing out and get you ready,
For God is coming, He's now at hand
Defender of lonely widows,
Father of orphans in all the land.

3. O God, You helped Your people,
When in the desert they went through hell.
The earth did shake and tremble,
Before the God of Israel.

4. You sent a soothing shower,
When it was weary You sent some more,
Your flock hid in Your goodness,
You gave the land back to the poor.

5. Bless God who brings salvation,
He breaks the sinner and every foe
And God has brought deliverance.
And taken 'way our every foe.

6. Bless God in festive meetings,
The Lord of Judah and Israel
Go in, follow your leader,
Go clap your hands and ring a bell.

7. Go forth, O God most mighty
From Your great temple Jerusalem.
Rebuke the warring nations,
Accept as gifts their every gem.
