title: Eternal Father, Strong to Save

---

1. Eternal Father, strong to save,
Whose arm doth bind the restless wave,
Who bid'st the mighty ocean deep
Its own appointed limits keep:
O hear us when we cry to the
For those in peril on the sea.

2. O Christ, the Lord of hill and plain
O'er which our traffic runs amain
By mountain pass or valley low;
Wherever, Lord, thy brethren go,
Protect them by the guarding hand
From ev'ry peril on the land.

3. O Spirit, whom the Father sent
To spread abroad the firmament;
O Wind of heaven, by thy might
Save all who dare the eagle's filght,
And keep them by thy watchful care
From ev'ry peril in the air.

4. O Trinity of love and pow'r,
Our brethren shield in danger's hour;
From rock and tempest, fire and foe,
Protect them wheresoe'er they go;
Thus ever-more shall rise to thee
Glad praise from air and land and sea.
