title: Must I Go and Empty Handed
---

_Chorus:_
_“Must I go, and empty-handed?”_
_Must I meet my Savior so?_
_Not one soul with which to greet Him:_
_Must I empty-handed go?_

1. “Must I go, and empty-handed,”
Thus my dear Redeemer meet?
Not one day of service give Him,
Lay no trophy at His feet?

2. Not at death I shrink nor falter,
For my Savior saves me now;
But to meet Him empty-handed,
Thought of that now clouds my brow.

3. Oh, the years in sinning wasted;
Could I but recall them now,
I would give them to my Savior,
To His will I'd gladly bow.

4. Up, ye saints, arise, be earnest,
Up and work while yet 'tis day;
Ere the night of death o'ertake you,
Strive for souls while yet you may.
