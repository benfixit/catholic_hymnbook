title: He Sendeth the Sunshine and Rain
---

_Chorus:_
_Bountiful, merciful, wonderful love._
_Bountiful, merciful, wonderful love._

1. He sendeth the sunshine and rain,
He scattereth dew on the flowers;
He maketh the desert to bloom
His blessings descend as the showers.

2. He causeth the rivers to flow,
The fields now with verdure are clad;
He tempers the wind to His lambs,
The earth with His fullness is glad.

3. For bounty so royal and free,
For mercies unending and new,
Oh, help us to praise Thee, dear Lord,
And serve Thee in all that we do.
