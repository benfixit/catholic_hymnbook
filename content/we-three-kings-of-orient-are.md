title: We Three Kings of Orient Are

---

_Chorus:_
_O star of wonder; star of night_
_Star with royal beauty bright_
_Westward leading, still proceeding_
_Guide us to Thy perfect light._

1. We three kings of Orients are
Bearing gifts we traverse afar
Field and fountain, moor and mountain
Following yonder star.

2. Born a king on Bethlehem's plain
Gold I bring to crown Him again
King forever, ceasing never
Over us all to reign.

3. Frankincense to offer have I
Incense owns a Deity nigh
Prayer and praising, all men raising
Worship Him, God most high.

4. Myrrh is mine, its bitter perfume
Breathes a life of gathering gloom
Sorrowing, sighing, bleeding, dying
Sealed in the stone-cold tomb.

5. Glorious now, behold Him arise
King and God, and sacrifice
Alleluia, alleluia
Earth to the heaven replies.
