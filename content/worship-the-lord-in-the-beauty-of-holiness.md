title: Worship the Lord in the Beauty of Holiness

---

1. Worship the Lord in the beauty of holiness;
Bow down before him, his glory proclaim;
Gold of obedience and incense of lowliness
Bring, and adore him: the Lord is his name!

2. Low at his feet lay your burden of carefulness,
High on his heart he will bear it for you,
Comfort your sorrows, and answer your prayerfulness,
Guiding your steps as may best be for you.

3. Fear not to enter his courts in the slenderness
Of the poor wealth which is all that you own.
Truth in its beaty and love in its tenderness,
These are the off'rings to lay at his throne.

4. These though we bring them in trembling and fearfulness,
He will accept for the Name that is dear,
Mornings of joy give for evenings of tearfulness,
Trust for our trembling and hope for our fear.

5. Worship the Lord in the beauty of holiness;
Bow down before him, his glory proclaim;
Gold of obedience and incense of lowliness
Bring, and adore him: the Lord is his name!
