1. Hail, holy Joseph, hail!
Husband of Mary, hail!
Chaste as the lily flower
In Eden's peaceful vale.

2. Hail, holy Joseph, hail!
Father of Christ esteemed,
Father be thou to those
Thy foster Son redeemed.

3. Hail, holy Joseph, hail!
Prince of the house of God,
May His blest graces be
By thy pure hands bestowed.

4. Hail, holy Joseph, hail!
Comrade of angels, hail:
Cheer thou the hearts that faint,
And guide the steps that fail.

5. Hail, holy Joseph, hail!
God's choice wert thou alone;
To thee the Word made flesh
Was subject as a Son.

6. Mother of Jesus, bless,
And bless, ye saints on high,
All meek and simple souls
That to Saint Joseph cry.
