title: Before the Day's Last Moments Fly
---

1. Before the day's last moments fly,
Maker of all, to thee we cry;
Beneath thy kind protection take,
And shield us for thy mercy's sake.

2. Let no ill dreams our souls alarm.
No pow'rs of night approach to harm;
Defend us from the tempter's art,
And keep us ever pure in heart.

3. Father of mercies, hear our cry;
O hear, co-equal Son most high;
whom with the Spirit we adore,
One only God for evermore.
