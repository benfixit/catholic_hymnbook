_Chorus:_
_Hark, now hear the angels sing,_
_A new King born today,_
_And man will live forevermore,_
_Because of Christmas day._

1. Long time ago in Bethlehem
So the Holy Bible says,
Mary's Boy Child Jesus Christ,
Was born on Christmas Day.

2. While shepherds watched their flocks by night,
They saw a bright new shining star,
They heard a choir sing a song,
The music seemed to come from afar.

3. Now Joseph and his wife, Mary,
Came to Bethlehem that night,
She found no place to bear her child,
Not a single room was in sight.

4. By and by they found a little nook,
In a stable all forlorn,
And in a manger cold and dark,
Mary's little boy was born.
