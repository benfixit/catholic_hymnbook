_Chorus:_
_Man of faith, man of hope_
_Sent to heal and sent to serve,_
_Man of faith, man of hope,_
_Sent to bring Your love to man,_
_And to love, love, love and serve, love and serve._

1. Praise be to You, God of all creation
For giving us this Bread we offer You today;
Fruit of the vine and the work of human hands,
It will become the bread of life
Blessed be God forever more.

2. Praise be to You, God of all creation
For giving us this Wine we offer You today
Fruit of the vine and the work of human hands
It will become the drink of life,
Blessed be God forever more.
