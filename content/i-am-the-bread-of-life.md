title: I Am the Bread of Life

---

_Chorus:_
_And I will raise him up, and I will raise him up,_
_And I will raise him up on the last day._

1. I am the Bread of Life,
He who come to Me shall not hunger;
He who believe in me shall not thirst.
No one can come to me unless the Father draws him.

2. The bread that I will give
Is my flesh for the life of the world,
And he you eats of this Bread,
He shall live forever, he shall live forever.

3. Unless you eat,
Of the flesh of the Son of Man,
And drink of His Blood; and drink of His Blood,
You shall not have life within you.

4. I am the resurrection,
I am the life,
He who believe in me,
Even if he dies, he shall live forever.

5. Yes, Lord I believe,
That You are the Christ,
The Son of God,
Who has come into the world.
