1. Come to me, Beloved
Babe of Bethlem;
Lay aside Thy scepter
And Thy diadem.

2. Bid all fear and doubting
From my soul depart,
As I feel the beating
Of Thy human heart.

3. Look upon me sweetly
With Thy human eyes;
With Thy human finger
Point me to the skies.

4. Guide me, ever guide me
With Thy pierced hand,
Till I reach the borders
Of the pleasant land.

5. Then, my own belove,
Take me home to rest,
Whisper words of comfort,
Lay me on Thy breast.

6. By the quiet waters
Sweetest Jesus, lead;
'Mid the Virgin lilies
Purest Jesus, feed.

7. Only Thee, Beloved,
Only Thee I seek,
Thee, the man Christ Jesus
Strength in flesh made weak.
