1. The God of Abraham praise,
Who reigns enthroned above;
Ancient of everlasting days,
And God of love;
The Lord, the great I AM,
By earth and heaven confessed:
We bow and bless the sacred Name
For ever blest.

2. He by himself hath sworn:
We on his oath depend;
We shall, on eagle-wings upborne,
To heaven ascend:
We shall behold his face,
We shall his power adore,
And sing the wonders of his grace
For evermore.

3. There dwells the Lord, our King,
The Lord, our Righteousness,
Triumphant o'er the world and sin,
The Prince of Peace;
On Zion's sacred heights
His kingdom he maintains,
And, glorious with his saints in light,
For ever reigns.

4. The God who reigns on high
The great archangels sing,
And “Holy, holy, holy,” cry,
“Almighty King!
Who was, and is, the same,
And evermore shall be:
Eternal Father, great I AM,
We worship thee.”

5. The whole triumphant host
Give thanks to God on high;
“Hail, Father, Son, and Holy Ghost!”
They ever cry;
Hail, Abraham's Lord divine!
With heaven our songs we raise;
All might and majesty are thine,
And endless praise.
