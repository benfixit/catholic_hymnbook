1. Soul of my saviour, sanctify my breast;
Body of Christ, be Thou my saving guest;
Blood of my saviour, bathe me in Thy tide;
Wash me with waters, flowing from Thy side.

2. Strength and protection, may Thy Passion be,
O Blessed Jesus, hear and answer me.
Deep in Thy wounds Lord, hide and shelter me,
So shall I never, never part from Thee.

3. Guard and defend me, from the foe malign;
In death's dread moments, make me only Thine;
Call me and bid me, come to Thee on high,
Where I may praise Thee, with Thy saints for aye.
