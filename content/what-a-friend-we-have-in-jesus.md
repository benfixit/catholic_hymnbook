title: What A Friend We Have in Jesus
---

1. What a friend we have in Jesus
All our sins and griefs to bear
What a privilege to carry
Everything to God in pray'r
Oh, what peace we often forfeit
Oh, what needless pain we bear
All because we do not carry
Everything to God in pray'r.

2. Have we trials and temptations?
Is there trouble anywhere?
We should never be discouraged
Take it to the Lord in pray'r.
Can we find a friend so faithful
Who will all our sorrows share?
Jesus knows our every weakness
Take it to the Lord in pray'r.

3. Are we weak and heavy-laden?
Cumbered with a load of care?
Precious Savior, still our refuge
Take it to the Lord in pray'r.
Do your friends despise, forsake you?
Take it to the Lord's in pray'r.
In His arms He'll take and shield you
You will find a solace there.
