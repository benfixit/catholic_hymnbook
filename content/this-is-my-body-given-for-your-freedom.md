_Chorus:_
_This is my Body, given for your freedom._
_This is my Blood which was shed for all of mankind,_
_Take, all, and eat, till the day of my return._

1. Peace to Sion, Jahweh's people;
Put your sorrows in my hands.
As I once led you to freedom,
Come now to my Father's house.

2. On your journey to the kingdom,
You will find the strength you need
At this table of remembrance
Of my rising from the dead.

3. Hear, my flock, now hear me calling
For I know you all by name.
Come with me, the Blessed Shepherd,
To the new Jerusalem.

4. When the whole world shakes with terror,
When the sky bursts into flame,
On the clouds shall I appear, and
You shall know my hour has come.
