_Chorus:_
_Alleluia;_
_Laetare, O Maria._

1. Be joyful, Mary, heav'nly Queen,
Gaude, Maria:
Your Son who died was living seen,

2. The Son you bore by heaven's grace,
Gaude, Maria:
Did all our guilt and sin efface,

3. The Lord has risen from the dead,
Gaude, Maria:
He rose with might as he had said,
