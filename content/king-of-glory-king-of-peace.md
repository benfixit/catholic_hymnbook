title: King of Glory King of Peace

1. King of glory, King of peace
I will love You;
And that love may never cease
I will move You.
Thou hast granted my request
Thou hast heard me;
Thou didst note my working breast
Thou hast spared me.

2. Wherefore with my utmost art
I will sing You;
And the cream of all my heart
I will sing You.
Though my sins against me cried
Thou alone didst clear me;
And alone, when they replied
You did hear me.

3. Seven whole days, not one in seven
I will praise You;
In my heart, though not in Heaven
I can raise You.
Small it is, in this poor sort
To enclose You:
Even eternity's too short
To extol You.
