1. Hail, glorious Saint Patrick, dear saint of our isle!
On us, thy poor children, bestow a sweet smile;
And now thou art high in thy mansions above,
On Erin's green valleys look down in thy love.
On Erin's green valleys,
On Erin's green valleys,
On Erin's green valleys look down in thy love.

2. Hail, glorious Saint Patrick, thy words were once string,
Against Satan's wiles and a heretic throng;
Not less in thy might were in heaven thou art;
Oh, come to our aid, in our battle take part.
Oh, come to our aid,
Oh, come to our aid,
Oh come to our aid, in our battle take part.

3. In the war against sin, in the fight for the faith,
Dear saint, may thy children resist to the death;
May their strength be in meekness, in penance, and prayer,
Their banner the cross which they glory to bear.
Their banner the cross,
Their banner the cross,
Their banner the cross which they glory to bear.

4. Thy people, now exiles on many a shore,
Shall love and revere thee till time be no more;
And the fire thou hast kindled shall ever burn bright,
Its warmth undiminished, undying its light.
Its warmth undiminished,
Its warmth undiminished,
Its warmth undiminished, undying its light.

5. Ever bless and defend the sweet land of our birth,
Where the shamrock still blooms as when thou wert on earth;
And our hearts shall yet burn wheresoever we roam;
For God and Saint Patrick, and our native home.
For God and Saint Patrick,
For God and Saint Patrick,
For God and Saint Patrick, and our native home.
