title: Glory to God on High

---

_Refrain:_
_Glory to God on high;_
_Peace to all good men._
_Honour and praise Him all of our days_
_And love Him in all mankind._

1. Sing out praise to God
For His wond'rous deed;
Know for sure that in His love
He answers all our needs.

2. Praise the Lord in prayer,
Praise the Lord in song,
Praise the Lord in all we do,
And we can't go far wrong.

3. Seek and you will find;
Ask and He will give;
Trust the Lord with all our might,
And then we'll always live.

4. Let us give Him thanks
For sending us His Son,
Who taught us all the way to love,
And the joy that's to be won.

5. God gave one command
So the Scriptures tell.
For in the love of all mankind
We love our God as well.

6. To the Father now give praise,
And praise be to the Son,
And by His Spirit's love in us
We know that God is one.
