title: The Advent of Our King
---

1. The advent of our King
Our prayers must now employ,
And we must hymns of welcome sing
In strains of holy joy.

2. The everlasting Son
Incarnate deigns to be:
Himself a servant's form puts on
To set his servants free.

3. O Zion's Daughter, rise
To meet thy lowly King,
Nor let thy faithless heart dispise
The peace he comes to bring.

4. As Judge on clouds of light,
He soon will come again
And his true members all unite
With him in heav'n to reign.

5. Before the dawning day
Let sin's dark deeds be gone,
The old man all be put away,
The new man all put on.

6. All glory to the Son,
Who comes to set us free,
With Father, Spirit, ever One,
Through all eternity.
