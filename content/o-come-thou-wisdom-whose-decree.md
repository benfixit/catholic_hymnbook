_Chorus:_
_Rejoice, rejoice,_
_Emmanuel shall come to Thee O Israel. (At Advent)_
_Emmanuel is born to save thee, O Israel. (At Christmas)_

1. O come, thou wisdom whose decree.
Doth governs all things peacefully,
The way of prudence here below.
And life hereafter deign to show.

2. O, come, thou everlasting Lord,
Who once by Israel's host adored,
Thy dread commandment madest known,
In majesty of glory show.

3. O Rod of Jesse, mystic bough,
From satan's cruel snares do thou,
From death's grim dungeon, we implore
And hell's abyss thine own restore.

4. O come, thou Key of David's store,
Unlock the heavenly gates once more;
Safe journey to thy courts bestow,
And shut the way that leads below.

5. O come, thou Daystar seen on high,
With healing for our hearts draw nigh;
Do thou the mists of night dispel,
And death's foreboding darkness quell.

6. O come, of Gentile hearts the King,
A world that needs thee ransoming,
And save thy servants, who confess
With humbled hearts their faithlessness.

7. O come, O come, Emmanuel,
Redeem thy captive Israel,
That doth in exile homeless mourn
Until her Saviour Christ be born.
