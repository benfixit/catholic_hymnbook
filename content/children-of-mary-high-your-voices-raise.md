1. Children of Mary, high your voices raise,
Ye on whom she casts her tender eye;
Children of God, sing her immortal praise,
And all exalt her glory to the skies,
Children of Mary, high your voices raise,
Children of God, sing her immortal praise.

2. I see ascending to her glorious throne,
The fervent pray'rs of ev'ry faithful child,
Each heart erects an altar to her name,
Where Mary lives in everlasting fame,
Where Mary lives in everlasting fame.
Children of Mary, high your voices raise,
Children of God, sing her immortal praise.
