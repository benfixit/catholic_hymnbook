title: The Lord's the Earth (Psalm 24)

_Chorus:_
_Open wide O you gates eternal_
_and let the King of Glory enter._

1. The Lord's is the earth and its fullness,
The world and all its peoples
It is He who set it on the sea;
On the waters He made it firm.

2. Who shall climb the mountain of the Lord?
Who shall stand in His holy place?
The man with clean hands and pure heart,
Who desires not worthless things.

3. He shall receive blessings from the Lord
And reward from the God who saves him.
Such are the men who seek Him,
Seek the face of the God of Jacob.
