1. O Christ, our hope, our hearts' desire,
Redemption's only spring;
Creator of the world art thou,
Its Savior and its King,
Its Savior and its King.

2. How vast the mercy and the love
Which laid our sins on thee,
And led thee to the cross to die
To set thy people free,
To set thy people free.

3. But now the bands of death are burst,
The ransom has been paid;
And thou art on thy Father's throne
In majesty arrayed.
In majesty arrayed.

4. O may thy mighty love prevail
Our sinful souls to spare;
O may we come before thy throne
And find acceptance there,
And find acceptance there!

5. Christ Jesus, be our present joy,
Our future great reward;
Our only glory may it be
To glory in the Lord,
To glory in the Lord!

6. All praise to thee, ascended Lord;
All glory ever be
To Father, Son and Holy Ghost
Through all eternity,
Through all eternity.
