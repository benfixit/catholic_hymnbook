_Chorus:_
_King of glory, hear our cry;_
_Make us soon thy joy to see,_
_Where enthroned in majesty_
_Countless angels sing to thee._

1. By the first bright Easter day,
When the stone was rolled away;
By the glory round thee shed
At the rising from the dead.

2. By thy parting blessing giv'n
As thou didst ascend to heav'n;
By the cloud of living light
That received thee out of sight.

3. By that rushing sound of might
Coming down from heaven's height;
By the cloven tongues of fire,
Holy Ghost, our hearts inspire.

4. See the Virgin Mother rise,
Angels bear her to the skies;
Mount aloft, imperial Queen,
Plead on high the cause of men!

5. Mary reigns upon the throne
Pre-ordained for her alone;
Saints and angels round her sing,
Mother of our God and King.
