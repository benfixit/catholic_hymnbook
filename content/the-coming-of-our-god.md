title: The Coming of Our God
---

1. The coming of our God
Our thoughts must now employ:
Then let us meet Him on the road
With songs of holy joy.

2. The co-eternal Son
A maiden's offspring see:
A servant's form Christ put on,
To set His people free.

3. Daughter of Sion, rise
To greet Thine infant King,
Nor let thy stubborn heart despise
The pardon He doth bring.

4. In glory from His throne
Again will Christ descend,
And summon all that are His own
To joys that never end.

5. Let deeds of darkness fly
Before the approaching morn,
For unto sin 'tis ours to die,
And serve the Virgin born.

6. Our joyful praises sing
To Christ, that set us free;
Like tribute to the Father bring,
And, Holy Ghost, to Thee.
