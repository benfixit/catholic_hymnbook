1. Little King, so fair and sweet,
See us gathered at thy feet:
Be Thou Monarch of our school,
It shall prosper 'neath thy rule.
We will be thy subjects true,
Brave to suffer, brave to do;
All our hearts to thee we bring,
Take them, keep them, little King.

2. Raise thy little hand to bless
All our childhood's happiness;
Bless our sorrow and our pain,
That each cross may be our gain.
Be thine own sweet childhood, Lord,
Sanctify each though and word,
Set thy seal on ev'ry thing
Which we do, O little King.

3. Be our teacher when we learn,
All the hard to easy turn;
Be our playmate when we play,
So we shall indeed be gay.
Keep us happy, keep us pure,
While our childhood shall endure,
All its days to thee we bring,
Bless them guard them, little King.

4. Be our leader in the fight,
In the darkness be our light,
O'er the rough and o'er the smooth,
Safely guide our wayward youth,
Whereso'er our path may be,
We will try to follow Thee,
To Thy mantle we will cling,
Help us, save us, little King.

5. Little King, so dear and sweet,
Here we cast before Thy feet
All we are or yet may be,
Every sense and faculty;
All our body, all our soul
We subject to Thy control
Let them all Thy praises sing,
Now and always, little King.

6. Let us in the noisy world,
Keep Thy banner broad unfurled,
In an age of ease and pride,
Leading Christian lives denied,
In an age which seeks its way,
Glad and cheerful to obey,
While Thy simple Truth shall ring,
In word and act, O little King.

7. And when holidays have come,
Call thy children to Thy home,
In that gentle voice of thine,
Which we know, sweet child Divine.
At the gate, oh, meet us thus,
As we loved thee, Child like us;
Stretch Thy hands in welcoming
To thine own, O little King.
