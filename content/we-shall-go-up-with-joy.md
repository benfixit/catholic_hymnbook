title: We Shall Go Up With Joy
---

_Chorus:_
_We shall go up with joy_
_To the house of our God_

1. I rejoiced when I heard them say;
“Let us go to God's house”
And now our feet are standing
Within your gates, O Jerusalem.

2. Jerusalem is built as a city
Strongly compact.
It is there that the tribes go up
The tribes of the Lord.

3. For Israel's law it is
There to praise the Lord's name
There were set the thrones of judgment
Of the house of David.

4. For the peace of Jerusalem, pray
“Peace be to your homes!
May peace reign in your walls
In your palaces, peace.

5. For the love of my brethren and friends
I say “Peace upon you!”
For the love of the house of the Lord
I will ask for your good.

6. Praise the Father, the Son and Holy Spirit
Both now and for ever
The God who is, who was and who will be
At the end of the ages.
