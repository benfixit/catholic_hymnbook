1. We offer You, O Father above
These earthly gifts of bread and wine
We give ourselves within this sign
O Lord, accept our gift.

2. The Lamb of God was offered for us
For men He gave His Body and Blood
We offer now this gift of love
O Lord, accept our gift.

3. We know we are not worthy alone
To worship at so holy a throne
And so with Jesus Christ we pray
O Lord, accept our gift.
