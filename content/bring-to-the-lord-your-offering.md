_Antiphon:_
_Bring to the Lord your offerings;_
_Adore Him in His holy place._

1. O give the Lord you sons of God,
Give the Lord glory and power;
Give the Lord the glory of His name;
Adore the Lord in His holy court.

2. The Lord's voice resounding on the waters
The Lord on the immensity of waters;
The voice of the Lord full of power,
The voice of the Lord, full of splendour.

3. The Lord's voice shattering the cedars,
The Lord shatters the cedars of Lebanon;
He makes Lebanon leap like a calf
And Sirion like a young wild-ox.

4. The Lord's voice shaking the wilderness,
The Lord shakes the wilderness of Kadesh;
The Lord's voice rending the oak tree
And stripping the forest bare.

5. The God of glory thunders.
In His temple they all cry: "Glory!"
The Lord sat enthroned over the flood;
The Lord sits as king forever.

6. Give glory to the Father Almighty,
To his Son, Jesus Christ, the Lord,
To the Spirit who dwells in our hearts,
Both now and forever. Amen.
