title: Rejoice, the Lord Is King
---

_Chorus:_
_Lift up your heart, Lift up your voice,_
_Rejoice, again, I say, rejoice!_

1. Rejoice, the Lord is King:
Your Lord and King adore!
Rejoice, give thanks and sing,
And triumph evermore.

2. Jesus, the Savior reigns,
The God of truth and love;
When he had purged our stains,
He took his seat above;

3. His kingdom cannot fail,
He rules o'er earth and heav'n;
The keys of death and hell
Are to our Jesus giv'n:

4. Rejoice in glorious hope!
Our Lord and judge shall come
And take his servants up
To their eternal home:
