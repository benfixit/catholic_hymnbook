_Chorus:_
_Light of Christ, light our way,_
_Light our way as we go._

1. The Lord is my light and my salvation,
whom shall fear?
The Lord is the stronghold of my life,
of whom shall be afraid?

2. He will hide me under the cover of His wings.
He will set me high on a rock.
And I shall dwell in the house of the Lord,
All the days of my life

3. The Lord is a lamp unto my feet.
He is a light to my path.
His light shall break forth like the dawn.
Arise for the light has come.
