title: Forty Days and Forty Nights
---

1. Forty days and forty nights
Thou was fasting in the wild;
Forty days and forty nights,
Tempted, and yet undefiled.

2. Shall not we thy sorrow share
And from worldly joys abstain,
Fasting with unceasing prayer,
Glad with thee to suffer pain?

3. Then, if Satan on us press,
Flesh or spirit to assail,
Victor in the wilderness,
Grant we may not faint or fail!

4. Keep, O keep us, Savior dear,
Ever constaint at thy side;
That with thee we may appear
At the eternal Easter tide.
