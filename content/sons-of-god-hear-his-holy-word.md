_Chorus:_
_Sons of God, Hear His Holy word,_
_Gather around the table of the Lord_
_Eat His Body, drink His Blood_
_And we'll sing a song of love_
_Allelu, allelu, allelu, alleluia._

1. Brothers, sister we are one,
And our life has just begun,
In the spirit we are young,
We can live forever.

2. Shout together to the Lord
Who has promised our reward,
Happiness a hundred fold
And we'll live forever.

3. Jesus gave a new command:
That we love our fellow man,
Till we reach the promised land
Where we'll live forever.

4. If we want to live with Him,
We must also die with Him,
Die to selfishness and sin
And we'll live forever.

5. Make the world a unity,
Make all men one family,
Till we meet The Trinity
And we'll live forever.
