title: In This Sacrament, Sweet Jesus

---

1. In this sacrament, sweet Jesus,
Thou dost give thy flesh and blood,
With thy soul and Godhead also,
As our own most precious food,
As our own most precious food.

2. Yes, dear Jesus, I believe it,
And thy presence I adore;
And with all my heart I love thee,
May I love thee more and more;
May I love thee more and more.

3. Come, sweet Jesus, in thy mercy,
Give thy flesh and blood to me;
Come to me, O dearest Jesus,
Come, my soul's true life to be,
Come, my soul's true life to be.

4. Come, that  Imay live forever,
Thou in me and I in thee;
Living thus, I shall not perish,
But shall live eternally.
But shall live eternally.

5. Blessèd be the love of Jesus,
Giving us his flesh and blood,
Blessèd be his Mother Mary,
Mother ever kind and good.
Mother ever kind and good.

6. Blessèd be the great Saint Joseph,
Sing then with devotion true;
Dearest Jesus, Mary, Joseph,
Heart and life I give to you.
Heart and life I give to you.
