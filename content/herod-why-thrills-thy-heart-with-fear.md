---

1. Herod, why thrills thy heart with fear?
The royal Babe thou seekest here
Envies no earthly toys, for He
A heavenly crown doth offer thee.

2. In haste to Bethlehem that day
The wise men took their star-led way,
Their light to seek, where light doth shew,
Gifts on the Giver to bestow.

3. Killed at the tyrant's anxious call,
For Christ a thousand victims fall;
And mothers' hearts the piteous tale
Of murdered innocents bewail.

4. Lo, dipped in Jordan's cleansing stream,
The Lamb of God would whiter seem;
Yet "twas our sins, in foul array,
He bore, and bearing washed away.

5. Marvels the Pharisees refute
That would His heavenly birth dispute;
The sick no more with fever burn,
And at His voice the dead return.

6. New evidence of wondrous power
Behold in Cana's marriage-dower;
Swift its own nature to resign,
The water blushes into wine.
