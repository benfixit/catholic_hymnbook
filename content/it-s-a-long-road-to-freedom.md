_Chorus:_
_It's a long road to freedom,_
_A winding steep and high,_
_But when you walk in love,_
_With the wind on your wing,_
_And cover the earth with the songs you sing,_
_The miles fly by._

1. I walked one morning by the sea,
And all the waves reached out to me,
I took their tears, then let them be.

2. I walked one morning at the dawn,
When bits of night still lingered on,
I sought my star, but it was gone.

3. I walked one morning with a friend,
And prayed the day would never end,
The years have flown - so why pretend?

4. I walked one morning with my King,
And all my winters turned to spring,
Yet every moment held it's sting.
