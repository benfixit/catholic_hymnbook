1. If we eat of the Lord,
And we drink of the Lord,
Like the Lord we shall all be.
Then we live with His life
And we share in His love,
And His truth will make us free.

2. The Lord tells us His plans,
Listen to His commands:
"To the Father come through Me;
Share this banquet of love,
Eat my flesh, drink my blood,
Do this in my memory".

3. "This command", says the Lord,
"I give especially to you
Love each man as I love you.
By this sign all will know
What I have to bestow,
Through this love, man I renew."

4. From this banquet of life
Bring my love, to the world,
Be a sign for all to see,
That I bring man my peace
Through the breaking of bread,
That I come to make Him free."

5. If we eat of the Lord
And we drink of the Lord,
Like the Lord we shall all be.
Then we live with His life
And we share in His love,
And His truth will make us free.
