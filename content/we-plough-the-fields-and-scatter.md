title: We Plough The Fields and Scatter

---

_Chorus:_
_All good gifts around us_
_Are sent from Heav'n above_
_Then thank the Lord, O thank the Lord_
_For all His love._

1. We plough the fields and scatter
The good seed on the land
But it is fed and water'd
By God's Almighty hand
He sends the snow in winter
The warmth to swell the grain
The breezes, and the sunshine
And soft refreshing rain.

2. He only is the Maker
Of all things near and far
He paints the wayside flower
And lights the evening star
The winds and waves obey Him
By him the birds are fed
Much more to us, His children
He gives our daily bread.

3. We thank Thee then, O Father
For all things bright and good
The seed time and the harvest
Our life, our health, our food
Accept the gifts we offer
For all Thy love imparts.
And what Thou most desirest
Our humble, thankful hearts.
