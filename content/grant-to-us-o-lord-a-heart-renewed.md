title: Grant to Us O Lord, a Heart Renewed

_Antiphon:_
_Grant to us, O Lord, a heart renewed;_
_Recreate in us Your own Spirit, Lord!_

1. Behold, the days are coming,
says the Lord our God,
when I will make a new covenant
with the house of Israel.

2. Deep within their being
I will implant my law,
I will write it in their hearts.

3. I will be their God,
and they shall be my people.

4. And for all their faults I will grant forgiveness;
Nevermore will I remember their sins.
