title: Oh! I Often Sit and Ponder

---

_Chorus:_
_Oh, the future lies before me,_
_And I know not where I'll be;_
_But where'er my path be leading,_
_Saviour, keep my heart with Thee._

1. Oh, I often sit and ponder,
When the sun is sinking low,
Where shall yonder future find me:
Does but God in Heaven know?
Shall I be among the living?
Shall I mingle with the free?
Wheresoe'er my path be leading,
Saviour, keep my heart with Thee.

2. Shall I be at work for Jesus,
Whilst He leads me by the hand,
And to those around be saying,
Come and join His happy band?
Come, for all things now are ready,
Come, His faithful follower be;
Oh, where'er my path be leading,
Saviour, keep my heart with Thee.

3. But perhaps my work for Jesus
Soon in future may be done,
All my earthly trials ended,
And my crown in Heaven won;
Then, forever with the ransomed
Thro' eternity I'd be
Chanting hymns to Him who bought me
With His blood shed on the tree.
