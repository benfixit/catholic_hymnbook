_Chorus:_
_Hail, Mary, ever undefiled,_
_Hail, Queen of purity!_
_O make thy children chaste and mild,_
_And turn their hearts to thee._

1. O Maid conceived without a stain,
O Mother bright and fair;
Come thou within our hearts to reign,
And grace shall triumph there.

2. O Mother, of all mothers best,
Who soothest every grief,
In thee the weary find their rest,
And anguish'd hearts relief.
