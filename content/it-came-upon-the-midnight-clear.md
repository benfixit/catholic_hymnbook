1. It came upon the midnight clear,
That glorious song of old,
From angels bending near the earth
To touch their harps of gold:
"Peace on the earth, good will to all,
From heav'n's all gracious King."
The world in solemn stillness lay,
To hear the angels sing.

2. Still through the cloven skies they come
With peaceful wings unfurled,
And still their heav'nly music floats
O'er all the weary world;
Above its sad and lowly plains
They bend on hov'ring wing,
And ever o'er its Babel sounds
The blessed angels sing.

3. And ye, beneath life's crushing load,
Whose forms are bending low,
Who toil along the climing way
With painful steps and slow -
Look now, for glad and golden hours
Come swiftly on the wing:
O rest beside the weary road,
And hear the angels sing!

4. For lo, the days are hast'ning on,
By prophets seen of old,
When with the ever circling years
Comes round the age of gold.
When peace shall over all the arth
Its ancient speldors fling,
And all the world give back the song
Which now the angels sing.
