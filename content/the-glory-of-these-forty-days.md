title: The Glory of These Forty Days

---

1. The glory of these forty days
We celebrate with songs of praise:
For Christ, by whom all things were made,
Himself hath fasted and hath prayed.

2. Alone and fasting Moses saw
The loving God who gave the law;
And to Elijah, fasting, came
The steeds and chariots of flame.

3. So Daniel trained his mystic sight,
Deliver'd from the lion's might;
And John, the Bridegroom's friend, became
The herald of Messiah's name.

4. Then grant us, Lord, like them to be
Full oft in fast and prayer with thee;
Our spirits strengthen with thy grace,
And give us joy to see thy face.

5. O Father, Son, and Spirit blest,
To thee be ev'ry prayer addrest;
Who art in three-fold Name adored,
From age to age the only Lord.
