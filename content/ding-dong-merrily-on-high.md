_Chorus:_
_Gloria, Hosanna in excelsis!_
_Gloria, Hosanna in excelsis!_

1. Ding dong! Merrily on high!
In heav'n the bells are ringing;
ding dong! Verily the sky
Is riv'n with angels singing.

2. E'en so here below, below,
Let steeple bells be swungen,
And io, io, io,
by priest and people sungen.

3. Pray you, dutifully prime
your matin chime, ye ringers;
May you beautifully rhyme
your eve time song, ye singers.
