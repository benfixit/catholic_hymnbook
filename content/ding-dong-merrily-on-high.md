title: Ding Dong! Merrily on High
---

1. Ding dong! Merrily on high!
In heav'n the bells are ringing;
ding dong! Verily the sky
Is riv'n with angels singing.

_Chorus:_
_Gloria, Hosanna in excelsis!_
_Gloria, Hosanna in excelsis!_

2. E'en so here below, below,
Let steeple bells be swungen,
And io, io, io,
by priest and people sungen.

3. Pray you, dutifully prime
your matin chime, ye ringers;
May you beautifully rhyme
your eve time song, ye singers.
