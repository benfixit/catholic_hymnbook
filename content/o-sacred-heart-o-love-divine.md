title: O Sacred Heart, O Love Divine

_Chorus:_
_Heart of Jesus, hear!_
_O Heart of Love Divine!_
_Listen to our prayer;_
_Make us always thine._

1. O Sacred Heart, O Love Divine!
Do keep us near to thee;
And make our love so like to thine
That we may holy be.

2. O Temple pure! O House of gold!
Our heaven here below!
What sweet delights, what wealth untold,
From thee do ever flow.

3. O wounded Heart, O Font of tears!
O Throne of grief and pain!
Whereon for the eternal years,
Thy love for man does reign.

4. Ungrateful hearts, forgetful hearts,
The hearts of men have been,
To wound thy side with cruel darts
Which they have made by sin.
