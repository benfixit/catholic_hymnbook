title: Whatsoever You Do To the Least of My Brothers

---

_Chorus:_
_Whatsoever you do to the least of my brothers_
_That you do unto Me._

1. When I was hungry you gave me to eat
When I was thirsty you gave me to drink
Now enter into the home of my Father.

2. When I was homeless you opened your door
When I was naked you gave me your coat
Now enter into the home of my Father.

3. When I was weary you helped me find rest
When I was anxious you calmed all my fears
Now enter into the home of my Father.

4. When I was restless you listened and cared
When I was lonely you gave me your love
Now enter into the home of my Father.

5. When in a prison you came to my cell
When on a sick bed you cared for my needs
Now enter into the home of my Father.

6. In a strange country you made me at home
Seeking employment you found me a job
Now enter into the home of my Father.

7. Hurt in the battle you bound up my wounds
Searching for kindness you held out your hand
Now enter into the home of my Father.

8. When I was laughed at you stood at my side
When I was happy you shared in my joy
Now enter into the home of my Father.
