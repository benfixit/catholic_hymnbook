title: It Is a Thing Most Wonderful

---

1. It is a thing most wonderful,
Almost too wonderful to be,
That God's own Son should come from heav'n,
And die to save a child like me.

2. And yet I know that it is true:
He chose a poor and humble lot,
And wept and toiled and mourned and died
For love of those who loved him not.

3. I cannot tell how he could love
A child so week and full of sin;
His love must be most wonderful
If he could die my love to win.

4. I sometimes think about the cross,
And shut my eyes, and try to see
The cruel nails and crown of thorns,
And Jesus crucified for me.

5. But even could I see him die,
I could but see a little part
Of that great love which, like a fire,
Is always burning in his heart.

6. It is most wonderful to know
His love for me so free and sure;
But ’tis more wonderful to see
My love for him so faint and poor.

7. And yet I want to love thee, Lord;
O light the flame within my heart,
And I will love thee more and more,
Until I see thee as thou art.
