title: Day is Dying in the West
---

1. Day is dying in the west,
Heaven is touching earth with rest.
Wait and worship while the night
Sets her evening lamps alight
Through all the sky.

_Chorus:_
_Holy, holy, holy, Lord God of Hosts!_
_Heaven and earth are full of Thee!_
_Heaven and earth are praising Thee._
_O Lord most high!_

2. Lord of life, beneath the dome
Of the universe, Thy home.
Gather us who seek Thy home,
To the fold of Thy embrace,
For Thou art nigh.

3. While the deepening shadows fall,
Heart of love, enfolding all,
Through the glory and the grace
Of the stars that veil Thy face,
Our hearts ascend.

4. When forever from our sight,
Pass the stars, the day, the night,
Lord of angels, on our eyes
Let eternal morning rise,
And shadows end.
