_Chorus:_
_Bread of Heaven, Bread of Heaven,_
_Feed me now and evermore;_
_Feed me now and evermore._

1. Guide me, O Thou great Redeemer,
Pilgrim through this barren land.
I am weak, but Thou art mighty;
Hold me with Thy powerful hand.

2. We gather Lord around Your table
Waiting for the Bread of life.
Make us worthy, make us holy,
Take away all sin and strife.

3. Living bread come down from heaven,
He who eats it shall not die.
Come and eat and live forever,
You shall live with God on high.
