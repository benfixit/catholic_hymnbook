_Chorus:_
_Keep in mind that Jesus Christ_
_has died for us and is risen from the dead._
_He is our saving Lord,_
_He is joy for all ages._

1. If we die with the Lord,
We shall live with the Lord.
If we endure with the Lord,
We shall reign with the Lord.

2. In him all our sorrow,
In him all our joy.
In him hope of glory,
In him all our love.

3. In him our redemption,
In him all our grace.
In him our salvation,
In him all our peace.
