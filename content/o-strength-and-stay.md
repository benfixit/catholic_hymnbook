title: O Strength and Stay

---

1. O Strength and Stay upholding all creation,
Who ever dost thyself unmoved abide,
Yet day by day the light in due gradation
From hour to hour thorugh all its changes guide.

2. Grant to life's day a calm unclouded ending,
An eve untouched by shadows of decay,
The brightness of a holy deathbed blending
With glories of the eternal day.

3. Hear us, O Father, gracious and forgiving,
Through Jesus Christ thy coeternal Word,
Who, with the Holy Ghost, by all things living
Now and to endless ages art adored.
