_Refrain:_
_For we are one in the love of Christ._
_If we die with him, we will rise up to life._

1. If in your life love abounds,
Seek no further for God is found.

2. O when your brother cries out tears,
Share with him his hopes and fears.

3. O when great joy fills your heart,
Open up, a smile will start.

4. Share all your good with your fellow man,
Walk together, hand in hand.

5. His Body we eat, his Blood we drink,
Of the Bread of Love we eat heartily.
