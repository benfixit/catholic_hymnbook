_Chorus:_
_When He comes back, when He comes back_
_Our lamps will be burning to welcome Him_
_When He comes back._

1. The Master has promised that He will return
On a night when there's no one expecting to see Him at all
Keep oil in the lamps so they're ready to burn
On the night of His secret
When those who are waiting He'll call.

2. Look not for the Master in heaven's dark space
By the light of our living on earth
we'll discover His face
The face of the Master is always at hand
In the face of the stranger, the poor
In the face of a man.

3. This stranger will search for His home in the night
And then how will He find it
unless all the windows are bright?
But if we are waiting - why then He'll come in
And there'll be a homecoming
With dancing and singing within.
