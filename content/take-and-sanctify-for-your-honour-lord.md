_Chorus:_
_Take and sanctify, for Your Honor Lord,_
_And sanctify these gifts, for Your Honor Lord._
_Take and sanctify these gifts for Your Honor Lord._

1. All that I am, all that I do
Everything I will ever make
Take my life and take my all
Everything I will ever make

2. All that I need, all that I pray
Everything I will ever have
Take my life and take my all
Everything I will ever have

3. All that I dream, all that I crave
Everything I will ever be
Take my life and take my all
Everything I will ever be
