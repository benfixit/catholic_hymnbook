title: Jesus, My Lord, Behold At Length the Day

---

_Chorus:_
_O pardon me Jesus;_
_Thy mercy I implore;_
_I will never more offend Thee,_
_No never more._

1. Jesus my Lord, behold at length the day,
When I resolve from sin to turn away.

2. Since my poor soul Thy Precious Blood has cost,
Suffer it not for ever to be lost.

3. Kneeling in tears behold me at Thy feet:
Like Magdalene, forgiveness I entreat.
