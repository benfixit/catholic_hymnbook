_Chorus:_
_He came from the glory,_
_He came from the glorious kingdom;_
_He came from the glory,_
_He came from the glorious kingdom._
_Oh yes, believer! Oh yes, believer!_
_He came from the glory,_
_He came from the glorious kingdom._

1. The virgin Mary had a baby boy,
The virgin Mary had a baby boy,
The virgin Mary had a baby boy
And they said that his name was Jesus.

2. The angels sang when the baby was born,
The angels sang when the baby was born,
The angels sang when the baby was born
And proclaim Him the saviour Jesus.

3. The shepherds came where the baby was born,
The shepherds came where the baby was born,
The shepherds came where the baby was born
And they saw that his name was Jesus.
