title: God's Spirit Is In My Heart
---

1. God's Spirit is in my heart,
He has called me and set me apart,
This is what I have to do,
What I have to do.

_Chorus:_
_He sent me to give the Good News to the poor_
_Tell prisoners that they are prisoners no more,_
_Tell blind people that they can see,_
_And set the downtrodden free._
_And go tell ev'ryone_
_the news that the kingdom of God has come,_
_And go tell ev'ryone_
_the news that God's kingdom has come._

2. Just as the Father sent me,
So I'm sending you out to be,
My witnesses throughout the world,
The whole of the world.

3. Don't carry a load in your pack,
You don't need two shirts on your back,
A workman can earn his own keep,
Can earn his own keep.

4. Don't worry what you have to say,
Don't worry because on that day,
God's Spirit will speak in your heart,
Will speak in your heart.
