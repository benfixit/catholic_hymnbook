_Chorus:_
_May the God of Israel join you in one;_
_In joy and in sorrow, the Lord is your way._

1. Blessed those who fear the Lord,
who seek His path,
For they shall find favour in His sight.

2. Blessed be the toil of your hands,
they shall bear fruit,
In joy and in gladness shall you work.

3. With good fortune in your home
shall you be blessed;
Your wife shall be like a fruitful vine.

4. Blessed shall your children be
around your board;
Like strong olive branches shall they stand.

5. Blessed indeed, shall be the man
who serves the lord;
For he shall prevail throughout his life.

6. May the Lord who dwells on high,
give joy to you;
And may He protect you all your life.

7. May the sight of many sons
delight your heart;
May God grant His peace to Israel.
