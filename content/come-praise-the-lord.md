1. Come, praise the Lord, you children of the Lord,
Come raise Your voice in Joyous song.

_Chorus:_
_Alleluia, alleluia, alleluia, alleluia._

2. Come, bless His name, you children of the Lord
Come, sing His praise and let the trumpet sound.

3. Rejoice in God, His love descends on us,
Lift up voice and sound His name afar.
