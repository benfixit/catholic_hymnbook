_Chorus:_
_Like a sunflower_
_That follows every movement of the sun,_
_So I turn towards You,_
_To follow You my God._

1. In simplicity, charity, I follow
In simplicity, charity, I follow

2. In simplicity, honesty, I follow
In simplicity, honesty, I follow

3. In simplicity, fidelity, I follow
In simplicity, fidelity, I follow

4. In simplicity, purity, I follow
In simplicity, purity, I follow
