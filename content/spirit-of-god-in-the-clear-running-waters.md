title: Spirit of God in the Clear Running Waters

---

_Chorus:_
_Fill the earth, bring it to birth,_
_And blow where you will._
_Blow, blow, blow till I be_
_But the breath of the Spirit blowing in me._

1. Spirit of God in the clear running water
Blowing to greatness the trees on the hill.
Spirit of God in the finger of morning.

2. I saw the scar of a year that lay dying
Heard the lament of a lone whip-poor-will.
Spirit of God, see that cloud crying.

3. Spirit of God every man's heart is lonely
Watching and waiting and hungry until
Spirit of God, man longs that You only.
