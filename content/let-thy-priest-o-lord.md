title: Let Thy Priest O Lord

_Chorus:_
_Turn not, turn not, turn not away_
_the face of Thy Anointed._

1. Let Thy Priest O Lord
be clothed with justice,
And let Thy Saints rejoice,
Saints rejoice for David's sake.

2. O sing to the Lord,
sing to the Lord,
Make known His deeds,
Make known His deeds among the people.

3. God has set His people,
people free,
For His chosen ones joys,
And shouts of rejoicing.
(After verse 3, please repeat chorus two times)
