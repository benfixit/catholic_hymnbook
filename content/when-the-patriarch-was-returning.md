title: When the Patriarch Was Returning
---

1. When the Patriach was returning,
Crowned with triumph from the fray,
Him the peaceful king of Salem
Came to meet upon his way;
Meekly bearing bread and wine,
Holy priesthood's awful sign.

2. On the truth thus dimly shadowed
Later days a luster shed;
When the great High-Priest eternal,
Under forms of wine and bread,
For the word's immortal Food
Gave his flesh and gave his blood.

3. Wondrous Gift! The Word who fashioned
All things by his might divine,
Bread unto his body changes,
Into his own blood the wine,
What through sense no change perceives,
Faith admires, adores, believes.

4. He who once to die a Victim
On the Cross did not refuse,
Day by day upon our altars
That same Sacrifice renews,
Through his holy priesthood's hands,
Faithful to his last commands.

5. While the people all uniting
In the Sacrifice sublime,
Offer Christ to his high Father,
Offer up themselves with him;
Then together with the priest
On the living Victim feast.
