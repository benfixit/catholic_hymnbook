title: Oh the Love of My Lord is the Essence
---

1. Oh the love of my Lord is the essence,
Of all that I love here on earth.
All the beauty I see,
He has given to me,
And His giving is as gentle as silence.

2. Every day, every hour, every moment,
Have been blessed by the strength of His love,
At the turn of each tide,
He is there at my side,
And his touch is as gentle as silence.

3. There've been times when I've turned from His presence,
And I've walked other paths, other ways.
But I've called on His Name,
In the dark of my shame,
And His mercy is as gentle as silence.
