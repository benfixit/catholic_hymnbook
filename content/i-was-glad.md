title: I Was Glad (Psalm 122)
---

1. I was glad, I was glad, when they said unto me:
We will go into the house of the Lord,
I was glad, I was glad, when they said unto me:
We will go into the house of the Lord.

2. Our feet shall stand within your gates,
O Jerusalem, Jerusalem, Jerusalem
Peace be within your walls,
And prosperity, prosperity,
Be within your palaces, palaces.

3. They shall prosper, they shall prosper that love you.
They shall prosper that love you,
Amen, Amen.
