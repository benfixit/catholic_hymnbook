1. As the dewy shades of even,
Gather o'er the balmy air,
Listen, gentle Queen of heaven,
Listen to my vesper prayer.

2. Holy Mother, hear me hover,
Free my thoughts from aught defiled;
With thy wings of mercy cover,
Kepp from sin thy helpless child.

3. Thine own sinless heart was broken,
Sorrow's sword had pierced its care,
Holy Mother! by that token,
Now thy pity I implore.

4. Queen of sorrows, guard and guide me,
Let me to thine arms repair,
In thy tender bosom hide me;
Take me, Mother to thy care.
