title: Jesus Christ Is Risen Today

---

1. Jesus Christ is ris'n today,
Alleluia!
Our triumphant holy day,
Alleluia!
Who did once upon the cross,
Alleluia!
Suffer to redeem our loss.
Alleluia!

2. Hymns of praise then let us sing,
Alleluia!
Unto Christ, our heav'nly King,
Alleluia!
Who endured the cross and grave,
Alleluia!
Sinners to redeem and save.
Alleluia!

3. But the pains of which he endured,
Alleluia!
Our salvation have procured;
Alleluia!
Now he reigns above as King,
Alleluia!
Where the angels ever sing.
Alleluia!

4. Sing we to our God above,
Alleluia!
Praise eternal as his love;
Alleluia!
Praise him, all ye heav'nly host,
Alleluia!
Father, Son and Holy Ghost.
Alleluia!
