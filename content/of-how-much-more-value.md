_Chorus:_
_Of how much more value are you than these!_
_Of how much more value are you than these!_

1. Look at the sparrow, he neither sows nor reaps;
He has no barn, no storehouse,
Yet your Father feeds him.

2. Look at the lily: she neither toils nor spins;
Yet not even Solomon in all his glory
Was arrayed like one of them.

3. Look at the green grass:
See how it flourishes in the fields.

4. So don't worry, don't be anxious, saying
"What shall we eat?" or "what shall we drink?"
"What shall we put on today?"
Your Father knows you need these things.

5. So give all, and be empty,
Then be filled with all good things.
