Accept Almighty Father,

These gifts of wine and bread,

Now offered at the altar

To You through Christ our head

In humble reparation

For sins and failings dread;

To gain life everlasting

For living and for dead.

O God, by this co-mingling

Of water and of wine

May He who took our nature

Give us His life divine

Come then, and make us holy,

Receive this sacrifice;

Into Your favour take us,

In Christ may we arise.
