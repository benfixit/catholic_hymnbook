_Chorus:_
_Praise the Lord, praise the Lord; let the earth hear his voice!_
_Praise the Lord, praise the Lord; let the people rejoice!_
_O come to the Father through Jesus the Son,_
_And give him the glory; great things He hath done._

1. To God be the glory, great things He hath done;
So loved Him the world that He gave us His Son,
Who yielded His life an atonement for sin,
And opened the life-gate that all may go in.

2. O perfect redemption, the purchase of blood,
To every believer the promise of God;
The vilest offender who truly repents,
That moment from Jesus a pardon receives.

3. Great things He hath taught us, great things He hath done,
And great our rejoicing through Jesus the Son;
But purer and higher and greater will be
Our wonder, our transport, when Jesus we see.
