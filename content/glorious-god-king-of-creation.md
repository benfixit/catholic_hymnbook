1. Glorious God, King of creation,
We praise You, we bless You,
We worship You in song;
Glorious God, in adoration,
At Your feet we belong.

_Chorus:_
_Lord of life, Father almighty,_
_Lord of hearts, Christ the King._
_Lord of love, Holy Spirit,_
_To Whom we homage bring._

2. Glorious God, magnificent, holy,
We love You, adore You,
And come to You in prayer.
Glorious God, mighty, eternal,
We sing Your praise ev'rywhere.
