title: King of Kings Is He Anointed

---

1. King of kings is he anointed;
Let all men adore him;
Lord above all lords appointed;
Let us bow before him.
Christ who leads us, Christ who loves us,
Christ our ruler from his birth,
He shall triumph, he shall triumph,
Over all the arth.
King of kings is he anointed
Over all the arth.

2. Son of God and yet our Brother,
Let all men adore him;
Son of Mary our sweet Mother,
Let us bow before him.
Christ who made us, Christ who saves us,
Christ who can all foes defy,
He shall triumph, he shall triumph,
From this throne on high;
Son of God and yet our Brother
From his throne on high.
