1. Jesus, Jesus, come to me,
All my longing is for thee,
Of all friends the best thou art,
Make of me thy counterpart.

2. Jesus, I live for thee,
Jesus, I die for thee,
I belong to thee,
Fore'er in life and death.

3. Comfort my poor soul distressed,
Come and dwell within my breast,
Oh how oft I long for thee,
Jesus, Jesus, come to me.
