title: How Great Is Your Name for Those Who Can See
---

1. How great is Your name, for those who can see
Where it's written all over the sky
Where the stars sing their praise
Spell Your name many ways
Or the eagles that fly, with the clouds on high
While the mountains declare:
"I am Lord everywhere, in the wide restless sea
That is shouting of me."

2. How clear is Your voice, for those who will stop
To hear what You have to say
It is heard in the breeze, as it rustles the leaves
Or the raindrops that spray, on a gray stormy day.
But the heart hears it best
When the mind is at rest
And the stubbornness will
Is surrendered and still.

3. How lovely Your face, for those who will see
Where it's found on earth everywhere
In the glance of a child, or a mother so mild
In a sinner's despair, or a saint that's in prayer
In every person that we meet
In a crowded city street
We can see where Your face
Is in the whole human race.
