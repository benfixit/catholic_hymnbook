title: O Come to the Throne of Grace

---

_Chorus:_
_O Lady of Fatima, hail!_
_Immaculate Mother of grace;_
_O, pray for us, help us today,_
_Thou hope of the human race!_

1. O come to the throne of grace,
O come to the heart most pure!
To Mary, our hope of life,
In whom Salvation is sure.

2. Immaculate Heart! we kneel
To consecrate all to thee:
The present, its pain and joy
The future, all it may be.
