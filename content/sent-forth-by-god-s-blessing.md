1. Sent forth by God's blessing, our true faith confessing,
The people of God from His dwelling take leave.
God's sacrifice ended, O now be extended
The fruits of this Mass in all hearts who believe.
The seed of his teaching, our inner souls reaching,
Shall blossom in action for God and for man.
His grace shall incite us, His love shall unite us.
To further His Kingdom by God's holy plan.

2. With praise and thanksgiving to God who is living,
The tasks of our ev'ryday life we embrace.
Our faith ever sharing, in love ever caring,
We claim as our brothers all men of each race.
One bread that has fed us, one light that has lead us;
Unite us as one in His life that we share.
Then may all the living, with praise and thanksgiving
Give honour to Christ and His name that we bear.
