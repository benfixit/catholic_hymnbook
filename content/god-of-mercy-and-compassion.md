title: God of Mercy and Compassion

---

1. God of mercy and compassion,
Look with pity upon me.
Father, let me call the Father,
'Tis thy child returns to thee.

_Chorus:_
_Jesus, Lord, I ask for mercy;_
_Let me not implore in vain._
_All my sins, I now detest them,_
_Never will I sin again._

2. By my sins I have deservèd
Death and endless misery,
Hell with all its pains and torments,
And for all eternity.

3. By my sins I have abandoned
Right and claim to heav'n above
Where the sints rejoice forever
In a boundless sea of love.

4. See our Savior, bleeding, dying,
On the cross of Calvary;
To that cross my sins have nailed him,
Yet he bleeds and dies for me.
