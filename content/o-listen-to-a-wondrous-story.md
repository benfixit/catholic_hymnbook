_Chorus:_
_Who saved us from eternal loss?_
_Who but God's Son upon the cross?_
_What did He do?_
_He died for us! Where is He now?_
_Believe it Thee in Heaven interceding._

1. O listen to our wondrous story,
Counted once among the lost;
Yet One came down from Heaven's glory,
Saving us at awful cost.

2. No angel could His place have taken,
Highest of the high though He;
The loved One on the cross forsaken,
Was One of the Godhead Three!

3. Will you surrender to this Saviour?
To His sceptre humbly bow?
You, too, shall come to know His favor,
He will save you, save you now.
