title: O for a Thousand Tongues to Sing
---

1. O for a thousand tongues to sing
My great Redeemer's praise,
The glories of my God and King,
The triumphs of his grace!

2. Jesus, the Name that charms our fears,
And bids our sorrows cease;
'Tis music in the sinner's ears,
'Tis life and health and peace.

3. He speaks; and, list'ning to his voice,
New life the dead receive,
The mournful broken hearts rejoice,
The humble poor believe.

4. Hear him, ye deaf; his praise, ye dumb,
Your loosened tongues employ;
Ye blind, behold, your Savior come;
And leap, ye lame, for joy!

5. My gracious Master and my God,
Assist me to proclaim
And spread through all the earth abroad
The honors of thy Name.
