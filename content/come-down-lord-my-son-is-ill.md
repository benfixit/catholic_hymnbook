1. Come down Lord, my son is ill;
Wracked with fever the livelong day,
He is life to me if You will,
Drive death away, drive death away,
Lord do not come to my house, I'm unworthy,
Speak and the promise is sealed,
For when Your Word, O God, is spoken,
He shall be healed, he shall be healed.

2. Come down, Lord, my soul is ill,
Wracked with anguish, the livelong day,
All my sorrowing will be still,
If You but stay, if You but stay,
Lord do not come to my house, I'm unworthy,
Speak and the promise is sealed,
For when Your Word, O God, is spoken,
He shall be healed, he shall be healed.

3. Come down, Lord, this world is ill,
Wracked with bloodshed, the livelong day,
Man must struggle for peace until,
You show the way, You show the way,
Lord do not come to my house, I'm unworthy,
Speak and the promise is sealed,
For when Your Word, O God, is spoken,
He shall be healed, he shall be healed.
