title: O Food to Pilgrims Given

---

1. O Food to pilgrims given,
Bread of the hosts of Heaven,
Thou Manna of the sky!
Feed with the blessed sweetness,
Of thy divine completeness
The hearts that for thee sigh.

2. O Fountain ruby glowing,
O Stream of love out-flowing
From Jesus' piercèd Side!
This thought alone shall bless us
This one desire posess us,
To drink of thy sweet tide.

3. We love thee, Jesu tender,
Who hid'st thine aweful splendor
Beneath these veils of grace:
O let the veils be riven,
And our clear eye in heaven
Behold thee face to face.
