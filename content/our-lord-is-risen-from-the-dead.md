title: Our Lord is Risen From the Dead
---

_Chorus:_
_Who is this King of glory?_
_The Lord, that all His foes o'ercame;_
_The world, sin, death, and hell o'erthrew;_
_And Jesus is the Conqueror's name,_
_And Jesus is the Conqueror's name._

1. Our Lord is risen from the dead!
Our Jesus is gone up on high!
The powers of hell are captive led,
Dragged to the portals of the sky.

2. There His triumphal chariot waits,
And angels chant the solemn lay:
Lift up your heads, you heav'nly gates;
Ye everlasting doors, give way.

3. Loose all your bars of massy light,
And wide unfold the ethereal scene;
He claims these mansions as His right
Receive the King of glory in.
