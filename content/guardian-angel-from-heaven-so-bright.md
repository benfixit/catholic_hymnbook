_Chorus:_
_Beautiful Angel, my guardian so mild,_
_Tenderly guide me, for I am thy child._

1. Guardian Angel! from heaven so bright,
Watching beside me to lead me aright,
Fold thy wings round me, oh, guard me with love.
Softly sing songs to me of heav'n above.

2. Angel so holy! whom God sends to me,
Sinful and lowly, my guardian to be,
Wilt thou not cherish the child of thy care?
Let me not perish; my trust is thy prayer.

3. O may I never forget thou at near;
But keep me ever in love and in fear.
Waking and sleeping in labor and rest.
In thy sweet keeping my life shall be blest.

4. Angel, dear Angel! Oh, close by me stay;
Safe from harm shield me, all ill keep away.
Then thou wilt lead me when this life is o'er
To Jesus and Mary to praise ever more.
