_Chorus:_
_My prayers rise like incense,_
_my hands like an evening offering._

1. I call to you, Lord, help me now,
listen to me when I call to you.
Lord I say to you, hear me,
listen to me, Lord, I am invoking you.

2. Lord place a guard over my mouth,
a sentry at the door of my lips,
keep my heart from inclining to evil.
Save me from all wicked deeds and desires,
listen to me, Lord, I am invoking you.

3. May the righteous reprove in kindness,
but I will not let the wicked anoint my hand.
I will always resist their evil deeds.
Listen to me Lord, I am invoking You.

4. Lord God, my eyes are turned to you,
defend and protect me. In you take refuge.
Guard me from the traps they have set for me.
From the snare of those who do evil.
Listen to me Lord, am invoking you.

5. Glory to the Father and to the Son
and to the Holy Spirit.
As it was in the beginning, is now,
and shall be for ever.
Listen to me Lord, am invoking you.
