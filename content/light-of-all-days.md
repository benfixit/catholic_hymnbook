title: Light of All Days

1. Light of all days that were and be,
Maker of light, outflows from thee,
Whence on the world's unshapen frame
Light at the first beginning came;

2. Thou to the morn the evening ray
Joinest, and bid'st us call them day;
Now draws the void of darkness near;
We pray in sorrow; thou give ear.

3. Be not the soul, once made for thee,
Exiled from thy felicity,
Nor stayed by sin that weights and clings
From thinking on perpetual things;

4. Let it to heav'n's own gate arise,
Knock, and obtain th'eternal prize;
Now and hereafter evil shun,
Repent and purge all evil done.

5. Thou with the Father hear our prayer,
Who dost the Father's glory share,
And thou, proceeding from the twain
In equal everlasting reign.
