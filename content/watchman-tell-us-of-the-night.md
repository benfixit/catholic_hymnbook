title: Watchman, Tell Us of the Night

---

1. Watchman, tell us of the night,
What its signs of promise are.
Trav'ler, what a wondrous sight:
See that glory-beaming star.
Watchman, does its beauteous ray
News of joy or hope foretell?
Trav'ler, yes, its brings the day,
Promised day of Israel.

2. Watchman, tell us of the night;
Higher yet that star ascends.
Trav'ler, blessedness and light,
Peace and truth its course portends.
Watchman, will its beams alone
Gild the spot that gave them brith?
Trav'ler, ages are its own;
See, it bursts o'er all the earth.

3. Watchman, tell us of the night,
For the morning seems to dawn.
Trav'ler, shadows take their flight;
Doubt and terror are withdrawn.
Watchman, you may go your way;
Hasten to your quiet home.
Trav'ler, we rejoice today,
For Emmanuel has come!
