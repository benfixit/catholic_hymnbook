1. Rejoice! rejoice, believers,
And let your lights appear!
The evening is advancing,
And darker night is near.
The Bridegroom is arising,
And soon he will draw nigh;
Up, watch in expectation!
At midnight comes the cry.

2. See that your lamps are burning,
Replenish them with oil;
Look now for your salvation,
The end of sin and toil.
The marriage-feast is waiting,
The gates wide open stand;
Rise up, ye heirs of glory;
The Bridegroom is at hand!

3. Our hope and expectation,
O Jesus, now appear;
Arise, thou Sun so longed for,
Above this darkened sphere!
With hearts and hands uplifted,
We plead, O Lord, to see
The day of earth's redemption,
And ever be with thee!
