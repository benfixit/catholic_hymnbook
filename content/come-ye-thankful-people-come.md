1. Come, ye thankful people, come,
Raise the song of harvest home;
All is safely gathered in
Ere the winter storms begin;
God, our Maker, doth provide
For our wants to be supplied;
Come, to God's own temple come;
Raise the song of harvest home.

2. We ourselves are God's own field,
Fruit unto his praise to yield;
Wheat and tares together sown
Unto joy or sorrow grown;
First the blade and then the ear,
Then the full corn shall appear;
Grant, O harvest Lord, that we
Wholesome grain and pure may be.

3. Even so, Lord, quickly come
Bring thy final harvest home;
Gather all thy people in,
Free from sorrow, free form sin;
There, forever purified,
In thy presence to abide;
Come, with all thine angels, come;
Raise the glorious harvest home.
