1. Fading, still fading, the last beam is shining;
Ave Maria, the day is declining;
Safety and innocence fly with the light,
Temptation and danger walk forth with the night;
From fall of the shade to the bright, morning time,
Shield us from danger and save us from crime.
Ave Maria, Ave Maria, Ave Maria, audi nos.
