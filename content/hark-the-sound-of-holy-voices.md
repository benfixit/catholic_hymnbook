title: Hark! The Sound of Holy Voices

---

1. Hark! The sound of holy voices,
Chanting at the crystal sea,
Alleluia! Alleluia!
Alleluia! Lord, to thee;
Multitude, which none can numbr,
Like the stars in glory stand
Clothed in white apparel, holding
Palms of victory in their hand.

2. Patriach, and holy prophet,
Who prepared the way of Christ;
King, Apostle, saint, confessor,
Martyr and evangelist;
Saintly maiden, godly matron,
Widows who have watched to prayer,
Joined in holy concert, singing
To the Lord of all, are there.

3. Marching with thy cross, their banner,
They have triumphed, following
Thee, the Captain of salvation,
Thee, thir Savior and their King;
Gladly, Lord, with thee they suffered;
Gladly, Lord, with thee they died;
And by death to life immortal
They were born and glorified.

4. Now they reign in heav'nly glory,
Now they walk in golden light,
Now they drink, as from a river,
Holy bliss and infinite:
Love and peace they taste forever,
And all truth and knowledge see
In the beatific vision
Of the blessed Trinity.
