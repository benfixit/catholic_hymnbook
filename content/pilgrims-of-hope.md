_Chorus:_
_Like a flame my hope is burning,_
_may my song arise to you:_
_Source of life that has no ending,_
_on life's path I trust in you._

1. Ev'ry nation, tongue, and people
find a light within your Word.
Scattered fragile sons and daughters
find a home in your dear Son.

2. God, so tender and so patient,
dawn of hope, you care for all.
Heav'n and earth are recreated
by the Spirit of Life set free.

3. Raise your eyes, the wind is blowing,
for our God is born in time.
Son made man for you and many
who will find the way in him.
