_Chorus:_
_Alleluia, alleluia, alleluia._

1. Ye son and daughters of the Lord!
The King of Glory, King adored
This day Himself from death restored.
Alleluia.

2. All in the early morning grey
Went holy women on their way
To see the tomb where Jesus lay.
Alleluia.

3. Of spices pure a precious store
In their pure hands those women bore
To anoint the sacred body o'er.
Alleluia.

4. Then straightway one in white they see
Who saith, “Ye seek the Lord; but He
Is risen, and gone to Galilee”.
Alleluia.

5. This told they Peter, told they John
Who forthwith to the tomb are gone
But Peter is by John outrun.
Alleluia.

6. That self-same night, while out of fear
The doors were shut, their Lord most dear
To His apostles did appear.
Alleluia.

7. But Thomas, when of this he heard
Was doubtful of his brethren's word
Wherefore again there comes the Lord.
Alleluia.

8. “Thomas, behold my side”, saith He
“My hands, my feet, my body see
And doubt not; but believe in Me”.
Alleluia.

9. When Thomas saw that wounded side
The truth no longer he denied
“Thou art my Lord and God!”he cried.
Alleluia.

10. Oh, blest are they who have not seen
Their Lord, and yet believe in Him!
Eternal life awaiteth them.
Alleluia.

11. Now let us praise the Lord most high
And strive His name to magnify
On this great day, through earth and sky.
Alleluia.

12. Whose mercy ever runneth o'er
Who men and angel hosts adore
To Him be glory evermore.
Alleluia.
