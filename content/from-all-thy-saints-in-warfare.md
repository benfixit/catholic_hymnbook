1. From all thy saints in warfare,
For all thy saints at rest,
To thee O blessed Jesus,
All praises be addressed.
Thou, Lord didst win the battle
That they might conquerors be;
Their crowns of living glory
Are Lit with rays from thee.

2. Apostles, prophets, martyrs,
and all the sacred throng
Who wear the spotless raiment,
Who raise the ceaseless song
For these, passed on before us,
Savior we thee adore,
And walking in their footsteps,
Would serve the more and more.

3. Then praise we God the Father,
And praise we God the Son
And God the Holy Spirit,
Eternal Three in One,
Till all the ransomed number
Fall down before the throne,
And honor, power, and glory
Ascribe to God alone.
