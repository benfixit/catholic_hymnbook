title: On This Day, the First of Days

---

1. On this day, the first of days,
God the Father's name we praise;
Who, creation's Lord and spring,
Did the world from darkness bring.

2. On this day, th'eternal Son
Over death his triumph won;
On this day the Spirit came
With his gifts of living flame.

3. Father, who didst fashion man
God-like in thy loving plan,
Fill us with that love divine,
And conform our wills to thine.

4. Word-made-flesh, all hail to thee!
Thou from sin hast set us free;
And with thee, we die and rise
Unto God in sacrifice.

5. Thou who dost all gifts impart,
Shine, blest Spirit, in each heart;
Give us light and grace, we pray,
Fill our hearts this holy day.

6. God, the blessed Three-in-One,
May thy holy will be done;
In thy word our souls are free,
And we rest this day with thee.
