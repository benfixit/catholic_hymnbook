1. All peo­ple that on earth do dwell,
Sing to the Lord with cheer­ful voice.
Him serve with fear, His praise forth tell.
Come ye be­fore Him and re­joice.

2. Know that the Lord is God indeed;
Without our aid He did us make;
We are His folk, He doth us feed,
And for His sheep He doth us take.

3. O en­ter then His gates with praise;
Approach with joy His courts so true;
Laud, and bless His name al­ways.
For it is seem­ly so to do.

4. For why, the Lord our God is good;
His mer­cy is forev­er sure;
His truth at all times firm­ly stood,
And shall from age to age en­dure.

5. To Fa­ther, Son and Ho­ly Ghost,
The God whom Heav­en and earth ad­ore,
From men and from the an­gel host
Be praise and glo­ry ev­er­more.
