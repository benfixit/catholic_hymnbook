_Chorus:_
_Let us all come and bow,_
_Let us all come and kneel,_
_And to adore our God,_
_For His mercies 'bide with us._

1. Let us come to Him with song,
Sing the glory of His name,
For the Lord God is Almighty,
For His powers are greater than all,
Let us come to Him with song.

2. Let us come and sing to the Lord,
Let us make a joyful noise,
For the Lord God is Almighty,
The rock of our salvation.

3. All the earth is in His hands,
Heaven and the mountain are His,
And the sea that He had made,
And the whole earth are His hand made.

4. Let us all come and bow down,
Let us all come and kneel down,
Before Our Lord the Creator
Let us all come and bow down.
