_Refrain:_
_God is love, and he who abides in love_
_Abides in God and God in him._

1. The love of Christ has gathered us together
Let us rejoice in him and be glad.

2. By this shall all know that we are his disciples
If we have love, one for another.

3. Owe no man anything except to love one another
For he who loves his neighbour will fulfil the whole law.

4. O carry one another's burdens
And so you will fulfil the law of Christ.

5. The cup of blessing which we bless
Is it not fellowship in the blood of Christ?

6. The bread which we break,
Is it not fellowship in the body of Christ?

7. We many are one bread, one body,
For we all partake of the one bread.

8. This is the bread that came down from heaven,
He who eats this bread live forever.
