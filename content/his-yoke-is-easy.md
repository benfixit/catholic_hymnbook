_Chorus:_
_His yoke is easy; His burden is light._
_I've found it so; I've found it so._
_He leadeth me by day and by night_
_Where living waters flow._

1. The Lord is my shepherd; I shall not want.
He maketh me down to lie
In pastures green, He leadeth me
The quiet waters by.

2. My soul crieth out: Restore me again,
And give me the strength to take
The narrow path of righteousness,
E'en for His own name's sake.

3. Yea, tho' I should walk the valley of death,
Yet why should I fear from ill?
For Thou art with me, and Thy rod
And staff me comfort still.
