title: Hail the Day That Sees Him Rise
---

1. Hail the day that sees him rise,
Alleluia!
To the throne above the skies;
Alleluia!
Paschal Lamb for sinners giv'n
Alleluia!
Enters now the highest heav'n.
Alleluia!

2. There for him high triumph waits:
Alleluia!
Lift your heads, eternal gates!
Alleluia!
Christ has conquered death and sin;
Alleluia!
Take the King of glory in!
Alleluia!

3. See, he lifts his hands above;
Alleluia!
See, he shows the prints of love;
Alleluia!
Through returning to his throne,
Alleluia!
Still he calls mankind his own.
Alleluia!

4. Highest heav'n its Lord receives,
Alleluia!
Yet he loves the earth he leaves;
Alleluia!
Hark, his gracious lips bestow,
Alleluia!
Blessings on his church below.
Alleluia!
