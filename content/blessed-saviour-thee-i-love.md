title: Blessed Saviour Thee I Love

---

1. Blessed Savior, Thee I love
All my other joys above;
All my hopes in Thee abide,
Thou my hope, and naught beside;
Ever let my glory be,
Only, only, only Thee.

2. Once again beside the cross,
All my gain I count but loss;
Earthly pleasures fade away,
Clouds they are that hide my day;
Hence, vain shadows!
Let me see Jesus crucified for me.

3. Blessed Savior, Thine am I,
Thine to live, and Thine to die;
Height or depth, or creature power,
Ne'er shall hide my Savior more;
Ever shall my glory be,
Only, only, only Thee.
