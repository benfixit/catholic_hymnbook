1. Although the way be lonely,
And darkness shadows fall
I know wherever it leadeth
My Father planned it all.

_Chorus:_
_I sing through the shade and the sunshine,_
_I trust in whatever befalls;_
_I sing, for I cannot be silent,_
_My father planned it all._

2. There may be sunshine tomorrow,
Shadows may break and flee,
It may be the way He chooses,
My Father plans for me.

3. He guides my faltr'ing footsteps
Along the weary way
For well He knows the pathway
Will lead to endless day.

4. A day of light and gladness,
On which no shade will fall;
'Tis this that last awaits me
My Father planned it all.
