title: The Fiery Sun Now Rolls Away
---

1. The fiery sun now rolls away,
And hastens to close of the day;
Thy brightness beams, O Lord, imprart,
And rise in our benighted heart.

2. To us the praises of thy name
Are morning song and evening theme;
Thus may we sing ourselves to rest
Amidst the music of the blest.

3. To God the Father and the Son,
And Holy Spirit, Three in One,
Be endless glory, as before
The world began, so evermore.
