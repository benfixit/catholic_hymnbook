_Chorus:_
_Laudate, Laudate, Laudate Mariam;_
_Laudate, Laudate, Laudate Mariam._

1. Raise your voices, vales and mountains,
Flow'ry meadows, streams and fountains,
Praise, O praise the loveliest maiden
Ever the Creator made.

2. Murm'ring brooks your tribute bringing,
Little birds with joyful singing,
Come with mirthful praises laden
To your Queen be homage paid.

3. Say, sweet Virgin, we implore thee,
Say what beauty God sheds o'er thee;
Praise and thanks to him be given,
Who in love created thee.
