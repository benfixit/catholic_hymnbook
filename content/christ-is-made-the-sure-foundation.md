title: Christ Is Made the Sure Foundation

---

1. Christ is made the sure foundation,
Christ the head and cornerstone;
Chosen of the Lord, and precious,
Binding all the Church in one,
Holy Zion's help forever,
And her confidence alone.

2. To this temple, where we call the,
Come, O Lord of hosts, today;
With thy wonted loving-kindness
Hear thy servants as they pray.
And thy fullest benediction
Shed within its valls alway.

3. Here vouchsafe to all thy servants
What they ask of thee to gain;
What they gain from thee forever
With the blessed to retain,
And hereafter in thy glory
Evermore with thee to reign.

4. Laud and honor to the Father,
Laud and honor to the Son,
Laud and honor to the Spirit,
Ever three and ever one;
Consubstantial, co-eternal,
While unending ages run.
