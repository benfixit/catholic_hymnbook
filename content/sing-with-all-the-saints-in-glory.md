title: Sing With All the Saints in Glory

---

1. Sing with all saints in glory,
Sing the resurrection song!
Death and sorrow, earth's dark story,
To the former days belong.
All around the clouds are breaking,
Soon the storms of time shall cease;
In God's likeness we awaken,
Knowing everlasting peace.

2. O what glory, far exceeding
All that eye has yet perceived
Holiest hearts, for ages pleading,
Never that full joy conceived.
God has promised, Christ prepares it,
There on high our welcome waits.
Ev'ry humble spirit shares it;
Christ has passed th'eternal gates.

3. Life eternal! heav'n rejoices:
Jesus lives who once was dead.
Shout with joy, O deathless voices!
Child of God, lift up your head!
Patriarchs from distant ages,
Saints all longing for their heav'n.
Prophets, psalmists, seers, and sages,
All await the glory giv'n.

4. Life eternal! O what wonders
Crowd on faith; what joy unknown,
When, amid earth's closing thunders,
Saints shall stand before the throne!
O, to enter that bright portal,
See that glowing firmament,
Know, with you, O God immortal,
Jesus christ whom you have sent!
