_Refrain:_
_Christ our Pasch has been slain, alleluia_
_Christ Himself, alleluia, alleluia, alleluia._

1. Pasch of the new law
The Spirit's holy feast;
O Pasch of Christ the Lord
Who for us has come to earth.

2. Pasch of the new law
O joy of all mankind;
The doors of life are wide
Giving life to us once more.

3. Pasch of the New Law,
The banquet hall is full of guests
The Lord has called,
That all men may share His feast.

4. Pasch of the New Law,
Behold your baptized saints
In robes of purest white
For the marriage of the Lamb.

5. Pasch of the New Law,
Our souls' immortal flame shines forth
In splendour bright,
never more to cease its light.

6. Pasch of the New Law,
O Christ who lives again.
the power of death You crushed,
You have given us Your life.

7. Pasch of the New Law,
we pray to You, O Lord,
stretch forth Your blessed hands
on the people You have saved.

8. Pasch of the New Law,
O Christ receive our songs;
to You be glory Lord,
with all joy and praise. Amen!
