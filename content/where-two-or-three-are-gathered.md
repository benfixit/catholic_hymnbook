_Chorus:_
_Where two or three are gathered together for my sake,_
_There am I in the midst of them._

1. If you come to eat
If you come to play
If you come to work
Or if you come to pray.

2. If you come in love
As I told you to
When you can call my name
I will be there with you.

3. If your skin is dark
If your skin is light
You are in my heart
And you are in my sight.
