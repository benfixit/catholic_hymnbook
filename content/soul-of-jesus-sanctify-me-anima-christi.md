1. Soul of Jesus, sanctify me.
Body of Jesus, save me.
Blood of Jesus, inebriate me.
Water from the side of Jesus, wash me.
Sacred Heart of Jesus, inflame me.
Passion of Jesus, strengthen me.
O good Jesus, hear me.
Within Thy wounds hide me.
Suffer me not to be separated from Thee
From the malicious enemy, defend me.
At the hour of my death, call me.
And bid me come to Thee
That with Thy saints
I may praise Thee, for all eternity.
