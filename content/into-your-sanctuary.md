_Chorus:_
_Into your sanctuary,_
_We've come to adore you Lord_
_Into your sanctuary,_
_We've come to adore you Lord_
_In adoration and praise,_
_We glorify your  holy name_
_Into your sanctuary_
_We've come to adore you Lord_

1. We thank you Lord
For the gift of life in us
We reverence Your Holy Name
Oh our God

2. With sweet melody of joy
Our mouth is full of praise
For one day in Your house
Is better than a thousand elsewhere

3. Hide us under the shadows of your wings
That we may overcome
The tribulations of the world

4. Let glory and honour be ascribed
To the Father, the Son and the Holy Ghost
Forever more.
