1. Hail, O Mary, full of grace,
Daughter true of David's race!
Thou, of women first and best,
Art beyond all others blest.

2. Fear not, thou shalt bear a Son,
Aided by the Holy One;
Greater than the greatest, he
Son of God most high shall be.

3. Thus the holy angel said.
Blessed Mary bowed her head:
Lo! the handmaid of the Lord;
With his word may all accord.

4. So to hearts still undefiled
Comes the promise of a Child,
Full of joy, akin to tears,
Full of hope, yet full of tears.

5. Happy she who answers still,
Be it, Lord, at thy sweet will;
All I am to thee I owe,
All thy purpose thou dost know.

6. What thou givest to be mine,
May it ne'er be aught but thine;
Be it good or be it ill,
Still be all at thy sweet will.

7. Holy Mary, taught by thee
Let us vain forebodings flee.
God is giving; fears must cease,
In his will is perfect peace.
