title: O Star, for Those Whose Pure Light
---

1. O star, for whose pure light the heav'n makes room,
Hope of the world thy death redeemed and won,
Though veiled thy rising in a Virgin's womb,
Before time was, the Father's Word and Son;

2. Strengthen the wav'rer; let thy Church below,
Still lifting unreprovèd hands to heav'n,
In worthier strains thy deathless glory shew,
And those free mercies count, thy grace hath giv'n.

3. Now doth the daystar, ush'ring in the dawn,
Salute this meaner sun's returning ray;
Fades the wan mist, from silver skies withdrawn;
Shine in our hearts, more pure, more welcome Day.

4. Sustain our weakness, light our path obscure,
Pierce the dull shades of this dark night beneath;
Arm our frail thoughts against the dazzling lure
Of those deceitful loves whose fruit is death.

5. Mysterious Trinity, be endless praise,
Father, and Son, and Holy Spirit, thine,
Long as time's star this twilight world displays,
And when outwearied suns no more shall shine.
