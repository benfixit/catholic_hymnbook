title: Magnificat- My Soul Now Glorifies the Lord My God

---

1. My soul now glorifes, the Lord my God
My spirit sings His praise, the Lord my God
Rejoice for whom am I, from now all ages
Will call me blessed, the lord my God.

2. Most holy is His name, the Lord my God
His gift He has outpoured, the lord my God
In me is manifest, God's greatness and glory
I magnify the Lord, the Lord my God.

3. His mercy is forever, the Lord my God
For those who keep His laws, the Lord my God
He puts His arms in strength and down He brings the proud,
He exalts the lowly, the Lord my God.

4. Glorify, the Father, the Lord my God
And Jesus Christ His Son, the Lord my God
And praise the Spirit, with them in unity
Now and forever more, the Lord my God.
