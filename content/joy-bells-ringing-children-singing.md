title: Joy-Bells Ringing Children Singing
---

_Chorus:_
_Joy-bells! Joy-bells!_
_Never, never cease your ringing!_
_Children! Children!_
_Never, never cease your singing!_
_List, list, the song that swells_
_Joy-bells! Joy-bells!_

1. Joy-bells ringing, children singing,
Fill the air with music sweet;
Joyful measure, guileless pleasure,
Make the chain of song complete.

2. Joy-bells ringing, children singing,
Hark their voices loud and clear,
Breaking o'er us, like a chorus,
From a purer, happier sphere.

3. Earth seems brighter, hearts grow lighter,
As the gladsome melody
Charms our sadness into gladness,
Pealing, pealing joyfully.

4. Joy-bells nearer sound, and clearer,
When the heart is free from care;
Skies are cheering, and we're hearing
Joy-bells ringing everywhere.
