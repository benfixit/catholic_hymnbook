title: Soul of My Savior
---

1. Soul of my Savior, sanctify my breast;
Body of christ, be thou my saving guest;
Blood of my Savior, bathe me in thy tide;
Wash me with water flowing from thy side.

2. Strength and protection may thy passion be;
O blessed Jesus, hear and answer me;
Deep in thy wounds, Lord, hide and shelter me;
So shall I never, never part from thee.

3. Guard and defend me from the foe malign;
In death's drear moments make me only thine;
Call me and bid me come to thee on high,
Where I may praise thee with thy saints for aye.
