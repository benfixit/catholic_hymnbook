1. John saw the number, of all those redeemed,
And all were singing praises to the Lord.
Thousands were praying, ten thousands rejoicing
And all were singing praises to the Lord.

2. There is no God as great as You O Lord
There is none, there is none) 2x
There is no God who does the mighty wonders
That the Lord our God has done) 2x
Neither with an army, nor with their weapons,
But by the Holy Spirit's Power) 2x.

3. And even mountains shall be moved) 3x
By the Holy Spirit's power.
            
4. And also Nigeria shall be moved 3x
By the Holy Spirit's power.
