_Chorus:_
_Ave, ave, ave, Maria!_
_Ave, ave, Maria!_

1. Immaculate Mary! Our hearts are on fire;
That title so wondrous Fills all our desire!

2. We pray for God's glory, May his Kingdom come;
We pray for his Vicar, Our Father in Rome.

3. We pray for our Mother, The Church upon earth,
And bless, sweetest Lady, The land of our birth.

4. O Mary! O Mother! Reign o'er us once more:
Be all lands thy "dowry" As in days of yore.
