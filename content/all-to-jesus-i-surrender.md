title: All to Jesus I surrender

---

1. All to Jesus I surrender,
All to Him I freely give;
All to Jesus I surrender,
Humbly at His feet I bow

_Chorus:_
_I surrender all, I surrender all,_
_All to Thee, my blessed Saviour;_
_I surrender all._

2. I will ever love and trust Him,
In His presence daily live.
Worldly pleasures all forsaken,
Take me Jesus, take me now.

3. All to Jesus I surrender,
Lord, I give myself to Thee;
Fill me with Thy love and power,
Let Thy blessing fall on me.

4. All to Jesus I surrender,
Now I feel the Sacred flame;
O the joy of full salvation!
Glory, glory to His Name!
