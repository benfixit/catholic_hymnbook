_Chorus:_
_Ave, Ave, Ave Maria,_
_Ave, Ave, Ave Maria!_

1. The thirteenth of May
In the Cove d'Iria,
Appeared oh so brilliant
The Virgin Maria.

2. The Virgin Maria
Encircled by light;
Our own dearest Mother
And heaven's delight.

3. To three shepherd children
Our Lady appeared
The light of her grace
To her Son, souls endeared.

4. With war and its evils
The whole world was seething,
And countless of thousands
Were morning and weeping.

5. By honouring Mary
And loving her Son
The peace of the world
Will most surely be won.
