1. Glory be to Jesus,
Who in bitter pains
Poured for me the life-blood
From His sacred veins.

2. Grace and life eternal
In that blood I find;
Blest be His compassion,
Infinitely kind.

3. Blest through endless ages
Be the precious stream
Which from endless torment,
Doth the world redeem.

4. There the fainting spirit
Drinks of life her fill;
There as in a fountain
Leaves herself at will.

5. Abel's blood for vengeance
Pleaded to the skies;
But the blood of Jesus
For our pardon cries.

6. Often as it is sprinkled
On our guilty hearts,
Satan in confusion
Terror-struck, departs.

7. Often as earth exalting
Wafts its praise on high,
Hell with horror trembles,
Heav'n is fill'd with joy.

8. Lift ye, then, your voices
Swell the mighty flood;
Lounder still and louder,
Praise the precious blood.
