1. Thy kingdom come; yea, bid it come,
But when Thy kingdom first began
On earth, Thy kingdom was a home,
A child, a woman, and a man.

2. The child was in the midst thereof,
O blessed Jesus, Holiest One!
The centre and the fount of love,
Mary and Joseph's little son.

3. Wherever on this earth shall be
A child, a woman, and a man,
Imaging that sweet Trinity
Wherewith Thy kingdom first began,

4. Establish there Thy kingdom! Yea,
And o'er that Trinity of love
Send down, as in thy appointed day,
The brooding spirit of Thy Dove.
