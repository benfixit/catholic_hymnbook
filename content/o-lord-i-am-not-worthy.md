1. O Lord, I am not worthy
That thou should'st come to me;
But speak the words of comfort,
My spirit healed shall be.

2. And humbly I'll receive thee,
The bridegroom of my soul,
No more by sin to grieve thee,
Or fly thy sweet control.

3. Eternal Holy Spirit,
Unworthy though I be,
Prepare me to receive him,
And trust the Word to me.

4. Increase my faith, dear Jesus,
In thy real presence here,
And make me feel most deeply
That thou to me art near.

5. O Sacrament most holy!
O Sacrament divine!
All praise and all thanksgiving
Be ev'ry moment thine!
