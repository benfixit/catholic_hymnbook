title: See, Amid the Winter's Snow

_Chorus:_
_Hail! thou ever blessed morn!_
_Hail, redemption's happy dawn!_
_Sing through all Jerusalem,_
_Christ is born in Bethlehem!_

1. See, amid the windter's snow,
Born for us on earth below;
See, the tender lamb appears,
Promised from eternal years!

2. Lo, within a manger lies
He who built the stary skies;
He, who throned in height sublime,
Sits amid the Cherubim!

3. Teach, O teach us, holy Child,
By thy face so meek and mild;
Teach us to resemble thee,
In thy sweet humility.

4. Sacred Infant, all Divine,
What a tender love was thine;
Thus to come from highest bliss,
Down to such a world as this!
