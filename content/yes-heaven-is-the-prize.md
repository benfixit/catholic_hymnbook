_Chorus:_
_'Tis heaven, 'tis heaven_
_Yes, heaven is the prize._
_'Tis heaven, 'tis heaven_
_Yes, heaven is the prize._

1. Yes, heaven is the prize
My soul shall strive to gain
One glimpse of Paradise
Repays a life of pain.

2. Yes, heaven is the prize
My soul, O think of this
All earthly goods despise
For such a crown of bliss.

3. Yes, heaven is the prize
When sorrows press around
Look up beyond the skies
Where hope and strength are found.

4. Yes, heaven is the prize
O, 'tis not hard to gain
He surely wins who tries
For hope can conquer pain.

5. Yes, heaven is the prize
The strife will soon be past
Fait not, but raise your eyes
And struggle till the last.
