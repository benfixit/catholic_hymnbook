_Chorus:_
_Showers of blessing,_
_Showers of blessing we need;_
_Mercy drops 'round us are falling,_
_But for the showers we plead._

1. There shall be showers of blessing:
This is the promise of love;
There shall be seasons refreshing,
Sent from the Saviour above.

2. There shall be showers of blessing,
Precious reviving again;
Over the hills and the valleys,
Sound of abundance of rain.

3. There shall be showers of blessing:
Send them upon us, O Lord;
Grant to us now a refreshing;
Come and now honor Thy word.

4. There shall be showers of blessing:
Oh, that today they might fall,
Now as to God we're confessing,
Now as on Jesus we call!

5. There shall be showers of blessing
If we but trust and obey;
There shall be seasons refreshing
If we let God have His way.
