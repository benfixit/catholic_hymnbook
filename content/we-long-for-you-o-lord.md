_Chorus:_
_Risen Saviour King of Glory_
_Come today in mystery_
_Let us share your death and rising_
_Till you come in majesty._
_(Chorus after verse 7)_
_Father, Son and Holy Spirit_
_Let us share Your family_
_Loving You and one another_
_Praising You eternally._

1. We long for You, O Lord
We long for You, O Lord
Come make us one with you in love
We long for You O Lord.

2. We cannot rest, O Lord
We cannot rest, O Lord
Come, Lamb of God, and give us peace
We cannot rest, O Lord.

3. We hunger for You, Lord
We hunger for You, Lord
Come, feed us now with living bread
We hunger for You, Lord.

4. Your flesh is strength, O Lord
Your flesh is strength, O Lord
Come, holy strong One, make us strong
Your flesh is strength, O Lord.

5. You live in us, O Lord
You live in us, O Lord
To be our Way, and Truth and Life
You live in us, O Lord.

6. You live in others, Lord
You live in others, Lord
Our love of them is love of You
You live in others, Lord.

7. You love through us, O Lord
You love through us, O Lord
We are your heart and hands and voice
You love through us,O Lord.
