title: Jesus, Keep Me Close to Thee

---

_Chorus:_
_All through life and at its closing,_
_Jesus, keep me close to thee;_
_All through life and at its closing,_
_Jesus, keep me close to thee._

1. Thou my ever lasting portion,
More than friends or life to me,
All along my weary journey,
Jesus, keep me close to thee.

2. Not for ease or worldly pleasure,
Nor for fame my prayer shall be;
Gladly will I toil and suffer,
Only keep me close to thee.

3. Lead me through this vale of sadness,
Till thine own dear Face I see;
Then the home of life eternal
May I enter, Lord, with thee.
