title: "Magnificat: God Fills Me With Joy"
---

_Chorus:_
_God fills me with joy, Alleluia._
_His presence is my robe, Alleluia._

1. My soul now glorifies
The Lord who is my Saviour.
Rejoice for who am I,
That God has shown me favour.

2. The World shall call me bless'd
And ponder on my story,
In me is manifest
God's greatness and his glory

3. For those who are his friends
And keep his laws as holy
His mercy never ends
And he exalts the lowly.

4. But by his pow'r the great
The proud, the self conceited
The kings who sit in state
Are humbled and defeated.

5. He feeds the starving poor
He guides his holy nations,
Fulfilling what he swore
Long since in revelation.

6. Then glorify with me
The Lord who is my Saviour,
One Holy Trinity
Forever and forever.
