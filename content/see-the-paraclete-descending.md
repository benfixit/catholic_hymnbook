title: See the Paraclete Descending
---

_Chorus:_
_Let us, alleluias singing,_
_Offer him our grateful lays,_
_He all heavenly graces bringing,_
_Merits everlasting praise._

1. See the Paraclete descending
Burning with celestial fire;
Grace and truth on Him attending,
Men with heavenly love inspire.

2. Timid souls no longer fearing,
Now the greatest dangers scorn;
Amidst their sorrows persevering,
Show themselves in Christ new-born.
