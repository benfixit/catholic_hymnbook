1. See the loving shepherd of Thy sheep,
The holy, the holy bread of angels,
From heaven, from heaven He came to earth,
Let us adore Him.

2. He is our true father all the time,
The shepherd, the shepherd of Thy sheep,
In Him, in Him we place our soul's redemption,
God full of kindness.

3. We are victims of our wretchedness,
Lord, O Lord, our Saviour,
Have mercy, have mercy on us all,
'Cause of Thy love for us.

4. Stay with us, stay with us in this world
O, o, o, good Jesus;
So that we, so that we may be with You,
In heaven forever.
