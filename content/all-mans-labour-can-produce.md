1. All man's labour can produce,
You have given for our use,
Take, O Lord, this offering.

_Chorus:_
_May this lowly bread and wine_
_Be the sacrifice divine_
_Of our Saviour Jesus Christ,_
_Of our Saviour Jesus Christ._

2. On this gift of bread and wine,
Of our sacrifice a sign,
Father, look with favour now.

3. May this food which strength imparts
Bring refreshment to our hearts,
And a taste of joy to come.
