1. Holy, holy Name of Jesus,
Name of sweetness we adore;
Lo, through ages still un-numbered
Was that Name in Heaven's store.
Hidden then in awful silence,
Now it sounds from shore to shore.

2. Hail! the hour when Angel's message
Brought that Name to Mary blest;
Hail! the joy that straight from heaven
Filled the Virgin Mother's breast;
Hail! the light upon his features,
When his Mother him caressed.

3. Angels' lips can sound none sweeter
Than the sweetness of that Name,
Earthly ears can list non better
For that Name from Heaven came.
Let us then with heav'n united
Offer homage still the same.
