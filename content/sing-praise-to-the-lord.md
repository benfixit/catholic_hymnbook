title: Sing Praise to the Lord
---

1. Sing praise to the Lord! praise God in the height;
Rejoice in his word, you angels of light;
O heavens, adore him by whom you were made,
And worship before him in brightness arrayed.

2. Sing praise to the Lord! praise God upon earth,
In tuneful accord, all men of new birth;
Praise him who has brought you his grace from above,
Praise him who has taught you to sing of his love.

3. Sing praise to the Lord! all things that give sound;
Each jubilant chord, re-echo around;
Loud organs, his glory tell forth in deep tone,
And trumpets, the story of what God has done.

4. Sing praise to the Lord! thanksgiving and song
To him be outpoured all ages along;
For love in creation, for heaven restored,
For grace of salvation, sing praise to the Lord!
