title: Christ, the Fair Glory of the Holy Angels
---

1. Christ, the fair glory of the holy angels,
Ruler of all, and author of creation,
Grant us in thy mercy grace to win by patience
Realms everlasting.

2. Send forth thine angel Michael from thy presence;
Peacemaker blessed, may he hover o'er us
Hallow our dwellings, that for us thy children
All things may prosper.

3. Send forth thine angel Gabriel the mighty;
On string wings flying, may he come from heaven,
Drive from thy temple Satan the old foe-man,
Succor our weakness.

4. Send forth thine angel Raphael the healer,
Through him with wholesome medicines of salvation,
Heal our backsliding, and in paths of goodness
Guide our steps daily.

5. May the blest mother of God and Savior,
May the celestial company of angels,
May the assembly of the saints in heaven,
Help us to praise thee.

6. Father almighty, Son, and Holy Spirit,
God ever blessed, hear our thankful praises;
Thine is the glory which from all creation
Ever ascendeth.
