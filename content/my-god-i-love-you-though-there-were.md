title: My God I Love You Though There Were
---

1. My God I love You - though there were
No heaven for me to win,
No hell to punish those who dare
Against Your love to sin.

2. Upon the cross, your wide embrace
Made me, dear Lord, your own;
The nails, the spear, the long disgrace
For me should all atone.

3. That night of fear, those hours of pain,
Those bitter griefs of yours,
That death itself was borne, to gain
A sinner's love 'twas mine.

4. And shall the fear of hell below
Or hope of heaven above
Be all the reason heart can know
This loving Lord to love.

5. That love that asks not anything,
Love like your own love free,
Jesus, I give, who are my King,
Who are my God, to You.
