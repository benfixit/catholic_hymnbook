_Chorus:_
_“Hold the fort, for I am coming,”_
_Jesus signals still,_
_Wave the answer back to Heaven,_
_“By Thy grace we will.”_

1. Ho! my comrades, see the signal,
Waving in the sky!
Re-inforcements now appearing,
Victory is nigh!

2. See the mighty host advancing,
Satan leading on;
Mighty men around us falling,
Courage almost gone.

3. See the glorious banner waving,
Hear the bugle blow;
In our Leader's Name we triumph
Over every foe.

4. Fierce and long the battle rages,
But our help is near;
Onward comes our great Commander,
Cheer my comrades, cheer!
