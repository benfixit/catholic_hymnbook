title: Help, Lord, the Souls That Thou Hast Made

---

1. Help, Lord, the souls that thou hast made,
The souls to thee so dear,
In prison for the debt unpaid
Of sin committed here.

2. These holy souls, they suffer on,
Resign'd in heart and will,
Until thy high behest is done,
And justice has its fill.

3. For daily falls, for pardon'd crime,
They joy to undergo
The shadow of thy Cross sublime,
The remnant of thy woe.

4. Oh, by their patience of delay,
Their hope amid their pain,
Their sacred zeal to burn away
Disfigurement and stain;

5. Oh, by their fire of love, not less
In keenness than the flame;
Oh, by their very helplessness,
Oh, by their own great Name;

6. Good Jesu, help! Sweet Jesu, aid
The souls to thee most dear,
In prison for the debt unpaid
Of sins committed here.
