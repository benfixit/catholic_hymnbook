1. Sweet Sacrament divine,
Hid in Your earthly home;
Lo! round Your lowly shrine,
With suppliant hearts we come;
Jesus, to You our voice we raise
In songs of love and heartfelt praise
Sweet Sacrament divine,
Sweet Sacrament divine.

2. Sweet Sacrament of peace,
Dear home of every heart,
Where restless yearnings cease,
And sorrows all depart.
There in Your ear, all trustfully,
We tell our tale of misery,
Sweet Sacrament of peace,
Sweet Sacrament of peace.

3. Sweet Sacrament of rest,
Ark from the ocean's roar,
Within Your shelter blest
Soon may we reach the shore;
Save us, for still the tempest raves,
Save, lest we sink beneath the waves:
Sweet Sacrament of rest,
Sweet Sacrament of rest.

4. Sweet Sacrament divine,
Earth's light and jubilee,
In Your far depths doth shine
Your Godhead's majesty;
Sweet light, so shine on us, we pray
That earthly joys may fade away:
Sweet Sacrament divine,
Sweet Sacrament divine.
