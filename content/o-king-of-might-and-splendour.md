1. O King of might and splendour,
Creator most adored,
This sacrifice we render
To Thee as sov'reign Lord.
May these our gifts be pleasing
Unto Thy Majesty,
Mankind from sin releasing
Who have offended Thee.

2. Thy body Thou hast given,
Thy blood Thou hast out-poured
That sin might be forgiven,
O Jesus, loving Lord,
As now with love most tender
Thy death we celebrate,
Our lives in self-surrender
To Thee we consecrate.
