1. My soul doth long for thee,
To dwell within my breast,
Unworthy though, O Lord, I be,
Of so Divine a Guest.
Of so Divine a Guest,
Unworthy though I be,
Yet hath my longing heart no rest,
Until it come to thee.

2. Until it come to thee,
In vain I look around;
In all I have, in all I see
No rest is to be found.
No rest is to be found,
But in thy sweet embrace;
Oh! when I have my Jesus Lord,
Naught else can take his place.

3. Naught else can take his place,
My soul longs more and more
To see my Jesus face to face
When this short life is o'er.
When this short life is o'er,
And weary strife shall cease;
O may I dwell forever more
In ever lasting peace.
