title: Hark! How the Banks of Jordan Ring
---

1. Hark how the banks of Jordan ring,
The Baptist's utterance echoing!
Your drowsy slumbers cast away,
Those warning accents to obey.

2. The conscious earth, and sea and sky,
Welcomes this Advent from on high,
Who did their groaning fabric build,
With pangs of expectation thrilled.

3. And shall our hearts un-purified,
The coming of their king abide?
Strew all his path, and lodging meet,
Prepare a royal guest to greet.

4. Jesus, our souls with health endow;
Our strength and consolation You;
Creatures of earth, without Your aid,
We languish like the flowers that fade.

5. Stretch out Your hand, we faint no more;
The fallen to their feet, restore,
Show but Your face, and wintry earth,
Shall bring her dallying flowers to birth.

6. Jesus, our ransomer divine,
Let praise beyond all praise be Yours;
Praise to the father endlessly.
And His life-giving Spirit be.
