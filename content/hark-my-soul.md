title: Hark, My Soul
---

1. Hark, my soul, how ev'rything
Strives to serve our bounteous King;
Each a double tribute pays,
Sings its part, and then obeys.

2. Nature's chief and sweetest choir
Him with cheerful notes admire;
Chanting ev'ry day their lauds,
While the grove their song applauds.

3. Though their voices lower be,
Streams have too their melody;
Night and day they warbling run,
Neer pause, but still sing on.

4. All the flowers that gild the spring
Hither their still music bring;
If heaven bless them, thankful, they
Smell more sweet, and look more gay.

5. Only we can scarce afford
This short office to our Lord;
We, on whom his bounty flows,
All things gives, and nothing owes.

6. Wake, for shame, my sluggish heart,
Wake, and gladly sing thy part;
Learn of birds and springs, and flowers,
How to use thy nobler powers.

7. Call whole nature to thy aid;
Since 'twas he whole nature made;
Join in one eternal song,
Who to one God all belong.
