1. People called by God through the word of prophets
People brought together in the house of the Lord,
People who attend to their God,
The Church of Christ the Lord.

Holy temple built upon Christ the Cornerstone;
Holy dwelling place of our God.
The church of Christ the Lord.

People who are marked by the seal of the Spirit;
People in the Spirit made one;
The church of Christ, the Lord.

Branches bearing fruits in the grace of the Lord;
Branches rooted in His great love;
The church of Christ, the Lord.

5. People justified by the grace of the Spirit,
People who are heirs of an everlasting life;
People now enlightened by Christ,

People who sit down to the new paschal supper;
Who shall pass from death into life;
The church of Christ, the Lord.

People called by God from the dakness into light;
Holy people called by God for His own;
The church of Christ, the Lord.

8. People whom the Lord has acquired for His praise;
People who put trust in the Lord Jesus Christ;
People called by God for His own;
The church of Christ, the Lord.
