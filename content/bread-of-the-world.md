1. Bread of the world, in mercy broken,
Wine of the soul, in mercy shed,
By whom the words of life were spoken,
And in whose death our sins are dead;
Oh, see the heart by sorrow broken,
Hear too the tears by Mary shed;
Blest is the Feast more than mere token,
The body broken, thy blood red.

2. Eternal Word, our Lord, our Savior,
Taking away our sin and shame,
Incarnate Love, our hope, our Treasure,
We worship and adore thy name.
O Lamb of God, our Friend and Brother,
We cry for joy to meet thee here;
Now send us out to do thee honor;
Stay with us till that day appear.
