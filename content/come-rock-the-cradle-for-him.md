title: Come Rock the Cradle for Him

---

1. Come, rock the cradle for Him,
Come, in the crib adore Him,
Dull care, I pray you, bury:
And in the Lord make merry,
Sweet little Jesu, sweet little Jesu.

2. Come rock His cradle lowly,
The throne of God all holy:
Come worship and adore Him,
And kneel we down before Him,
Sweet little Jesu, sweet little Jesu.

3. Do nothing to annoy Him,
But everything to joy Him:
For sin by night or morrow,
Would cause Him pain and sorrow,
Sweet little Jesu, sweet little Jesu.

4. So at your hour of dying,
This Babe in cradle lying,
For He is king supernal'
Shall grant you rest eternal,
Sweet little Jesu, sweet little Jesu.
