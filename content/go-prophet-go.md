1. Go, Prophet, go! Go Prophet, go!
Go to the ends of the earth for me!
Go, Prophet, go! Go Prophet, go!
Tell them of Christ's new victory!

2. Go to the night-clubs, cabarets,
Go where the rhythm rocks and wails,
Tell them of him who dances in death,
Show them his beat of whips and nails.

3. Go to the gaudy city streets,
Crowded with empty souls again.
Tell them of Christ upon a beam,
Abandoned by God to die with men.

4. Go to the haunts where men are trapped,
Caught by their guilt and misery.
Tell them of Christ who lives again,
Offers the power to set them free.

5. Live with the people whom you know,
Love them in all their pains and fears
Tell them the healing word of Christ,
Give them your laughter and your tears.
