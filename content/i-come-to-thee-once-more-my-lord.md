title: I Come to thee Once More My Lord
category: entrance

1. I come to Thee once more, my God,
No longer will I roam,
For I have sought Thee wide world through,
And never found a home.

2. Though bright and many are the spots,
Where I have built a nest,
Yet in the brightest still I pined
For more abiding rest.

3. Riches could bring me joy and power,
And they were fair to see
Yet gold was but a sorry god
To serve instead of Thee.

4. Then honour and the world's good word,
Appeared a nobler faith,
Yet could I rest on bliss that hung
And trembled on a breath.

5. For Thou hast made this wondrous soul
All for Thyself alone,
Ah, send Thy sweet transforming word
To make it more Thine own.
