title: Mary, Let Perpetual Succor
---

_Chorus:_
_Ever ready help hast thou,_
_Let thy children feel it now._

1. Mary, let Perpetual Succour
Be the answer, to our prayer,
For thy Son, of all the wretched
Gives to thee perpetual care.

2. Of our passions we are weary,
Weary of the yoke of sin;
Yet though longing to be holy,
Faint of heart we ne'er begin.

3. Though we try to rise, yet ever
Down in misery we fall;
So like feeble children sadly,
For our Mother's help we call.

4. Let us feel thy help in sorrow,
Mourners look for joy to thee:
Spurn not God's unhappy creatures,
Whatsoe'er their faults may be.

5. Succour all, both priests and people,
Who to thee thee their homage pay,
Toiling men and praying women,
Help them on thy festal day.
