title: My Soul Is Longing For Your Peace (Psalm 131)
---

_Chorus:_
_My soul is longing for your peace,_
_near to You, my God!_

1. Lord, you know that my heart is not proud,
And my eyes are not lifted from the earth.

2. Lofty thoughts have never filled my mind,
Far beyond my sight all ambitions deeds.

3. In your peace I have maintained my soul,
I have kept my heart in Your quiet care.

4. As a child rest on his mother's knees,
So I place my soul in Your loving care.

5. Israel, put all your hope in God,
Place your trust in Him, now and evermore.
