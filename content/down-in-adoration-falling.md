1. Down in adoration falling,
This great sacrament we hail;
Over ancient forms of worship,
Newer rites of grace prevail;
Faith will tell us Christ is present
When our human senses fail.

2. To the everlasting Father
And the Son who made us free
And the Spirit God proceeding
From them each eternally,
Be salvation, honor, blessing,
Might and endless majesty. Amen.
