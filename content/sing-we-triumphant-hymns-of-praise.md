title: Sing We Triumphant Hymns of Praise
---

_Chorus:_
_Alleluia, alleluia, alleluia,_
_alleluia, alleluia!_

1. Sing we triumphant hymns of praise
To greet our lord these festive days,
Alleluia, Alleuia!
Who by a road before untrod
Ascended to the throne of God.

2. In wond'ring awe his faithful band
Upon the Mount of Olives stand,
Alleluia, Alleluia!
And with the Virgin Mother see
Their Lord ascend in majesty.

3. O risen Christ, ascended Lord,
All praise to you let earth accord,
Alleluia, Alleluia!
Who are, while endless ages run,
With Father and with Spirit, One.
