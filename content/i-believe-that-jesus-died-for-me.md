_Chorus:_
_Father, to You we offer,_
_Oh Jesus, to You this gift we bring;_
_Holy Ghost, accept this offering_
_Which we offer up to You._

1. I believe that Jesus died for me;
A sacrifice beyond my understanding;
Offering Himself in place of me;
Oh how can I repay the Lord.

2. I believe all that the scripture said;
About the love beyond my understanding,
Forgiveness, beyond comprehension,
Oh how can I repay the Lord.

3. Teach me Lord, to love You as I ought,
Oh teach me lord to love You all my life time
Spreading love wherever I find myself
Oh how can I repay the Lord.
