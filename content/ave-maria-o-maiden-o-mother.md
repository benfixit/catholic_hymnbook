title: Ave Maria! O Maiden, O Mother

---

1. Ave Maria! O Maiden, O Mother,
Proudly thy children are calling on thee;
Thine are the graces unclaimed by another,
Sinless and beautiful, star of the sea!

_Chorus:_
_Mater amabilis, ora pro nobis,_
_Pray for thy children who call upon thee;_
_Ave Sanctissima, Ave Purissima,_
_Sinless and beautiful star of the sea._

2. Ave Maria! the night shades are falling,
Softly, our voices arise unto thee;
Earth's lonely exiles for succour are calling,
Sinless and beautiful, star of the sea!

3. Ave Maria! Thou portal of heaven,
Harbour of refuge, to thee do we flee;
Lost in the darkness, by stormy winds driven,
Shine on our pathway, fair star of the sea.
