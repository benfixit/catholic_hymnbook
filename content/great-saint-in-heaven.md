title: Great Saint in Heaven

_Chorus:_
_To God be glory, who gave they thy crown;_
_To us be courage and to thee renown;_
_So may we ever find strength in thy name,_
_Thee as our patronal Saint, we acclaim!._

1. Great Saint in heaven, our Patron we greet thee!
Be thou our well-spring of courage and light!
Guide thou our steps so that once we may meet thee;
Bright be thy beacon, tho' dark be the night.

2. Lead thou us onward through earth's pain and anguish,
Crosses and trials dishearten us here;
Temper our sorrows, whilst here we still anguish,
Make us wax strong in Christ's love and his fear.
