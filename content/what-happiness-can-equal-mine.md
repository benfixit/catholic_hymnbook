title: What Happiness Can Equal Mine
---

1. What happiness can equal mine?
I've found the object of my love
My Savior and my Lord Divine
Is come to me from heaven above.

2. He makes my heart His own abode
His flesh becomes my daily bread
He pours on me His healing blood
And with His life my soul is fed.

3. My Lord is mine and I am His
In me He dwells; In Him I live
Where could I taste a purer bliss?
What greater boom could Jesus give?

4. Dear Jesus now my heart is Thine
Oh, may it never from Thee flee
My God be Thou forever mine
And I Thine own eternally.
