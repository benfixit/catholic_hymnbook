title: Arise Come to Your God

---

_Antiphon 1:_
_Arise, come to our God,_
_Sing Him your songs of rejoicing._

_Antiphon 2:_
_Glory to You, O God!_

_Antiphon 3:_
_Alleluia, alleluia, alleluia._

1. Cry out with joy to the Lord, all the earth,
Serve the Lord with gladness,
Come before Him, singing for joy.

2. Know that He, the Lord, is God,
He made us; we belong to him,
We are his people, the sheep of his flock.

3. Go within his gates giving thanks,
Enter his courts with songs of praise,
Give thanks to Him, and bless His name.

4. Indeed how good is the Lord,
Eternal His merciful love,
He is faithful from age to age.

5. Give glory to the Father Almighty,
To His Son, Jesus Christ, the Lord,
To the Spirit who dwells in our hearts.
