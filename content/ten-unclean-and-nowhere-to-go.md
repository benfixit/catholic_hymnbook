title: Ten Unclean and Nowhere to Go

---

_Chorus:_
_Ten unclean and nowhere to go._
_Ten men cleansed as clean as snow._
_One returned to give God thanks,_
_But nine went away._

1. Ten men, lepers in a Hebrew town.
Ten crying: Lord, won't you please come down.
No hope near til one fine day,
Jesus of Nazareth passed that way.

2. "Lord make me clean", was their single cry.
"See, how the whole world passes us by.
No man's home will take us in!"
Then Christ bent down to touch their skin.

3. Like a tree when its buds come true,
Or a patch of spring that is fresh and new,
Christ restored the ones defiled,
Gave them the flesh of a new-born child.

4. God gives gifts to us every day,
Favors His people in every way;
Hope restored and pain relieved -
Do you ever give thanks for a gift received?
