title: Great Things Happen When God Mixes With Men

---

_Chorus:_
_Great things happen when God mixes with men (x2)_
_Great and beautiful, wonderful things,_
_Great things happen when God mixes with men._

1. Some find life, some find peace,
Some people also find joy,
Some see things as they never could before,
And some people find that they can now begin to trust.

2. Some find health,
Some find hope; some people even find joy.
Some see themselves as they never could before,
And some people find that they can now begin to live.

3. Some find peace, some are disturbed,
Some people even find joy.
Some see their lives as they never could before,
And some people find that they must now begin to change.
