title: Bring an Offering and Enter His Courts (Psalm 96)
---

_Antiphon:_
_Bring an offering and enter His courts;_
_In His temple worship the Lord._

1. O sing a new song to the Lord,
Sing to the Lord all the earth,
O sing to the Lord, bless His name.

2. Proclaim His help day by day,
Tell among the nations His glory
And His wonders among all the peoples.

3. The Lord is great and worthy of praise,
To be feared above all gods,
The gods of the heathens are naught.

4. It was the Lord, who made the heavens,
His are majesty and state and power,
And splendour in His holy place.

5. Give the Lord, you families of peoples,
Give the Lord glory and power,
Give the Lord the glory of His name.

6. Bring an offering and enter His courts,
Worship the Lord in His temple,
O earth, tremble before Him.
