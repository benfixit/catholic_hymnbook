title: Ave Maria! Thou Virgin and Mother

---

1. Ave Maria! thou Virgin and Mother,
Fondly thy children are calling to thee;
Thine are the graces, unclaimed by another,
Sinless and beautiful Star of the Sea.

2. Ave Maria! the night shades are falling,
Softly our voices arise unto thee!
Earth's lonely exiles for succor are calling,
Sinless and beautiful Star of the Sea.

3. Ave Maria! thy children are kneeling,
Words of endearment are whispered to thee;
Softly thy spirit upon us is stealing,
Sinless and beautiful Star of the Sea.

4. Ave Maria! thy arms are extending,
Gladly within them for shelter we flee;
Are thy sweet eyes on thy lonely ones bending,
Sinless and beautiful Star of the Sea.
