1. O, come, little children, O, come, one and all,
To Bethlehem's stable, in Bethlehem's stall.
And see with rejoicing this glorious sight
Our Father in heaven has sent us this night.

2. O, see in the manger, in hallowed light
A star throws its beam on this holiest sight.
In clean swaddling clothes lies the heavenly Child,
More lovely than angels, this Baby so mild.

3. O, there lies the Christ Child, on hay and on straw;
The shepherds are kneeling before him with awe.
And Mary and Joseph smile on him with love,
While angels are singing sweet songs from above.
