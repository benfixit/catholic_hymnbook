title: Blessed Jesus, at Thy Word
---

1. Blessed Jesus, at thy word
we are gathered all to hear thee;
Let our hearts and souls be stirred
now to seek and love and fear thee,
By thy teachings, sweet and holy,
Drawn from earth to love thee solely.

2. Glorious Lord, thyself impart,
Light of Light, from God proceeding;
Open thou our ears and heart,
help us by thy Spirit's pleading;
Hear the cry thy people raises,
Hear and bless our prayers and praises.

3. Father, Son, and Holy Ghost,
Praise to thee and adoration!
Grant that we thy Word may trust
and obtain true consolation
While we here below must wander,
Till we sing thy praises yonder.
