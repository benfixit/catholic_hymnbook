title: The Strife Is O'er
---

_Chorus:_
_Alleluia! Alleluia! Alleluia!_

1. The strife is o'er, the battle done;
Now is the Victor's triumph won;
O let the song of praise be sung:
Alleluia!

2. Death's mightiest pow'rs have done their worst,
And Jesus hath his foes dispersed;
Let shouts of praise and joy outburst:
Alleluia!

3. He closed the yawning gates of hell,
The bars from heav'n's high portals fell;
Let hymns of praise his triumph tell:
Alleluia!

4. On the third morn he rose again,
Glorious in majesty to reign;
O let us swell the joyful strain:
Alleluia!

5. Lord, by the stripes that wounded thee,
From death's dread sting thy servants free,
That we may live and sing to thee:
Alleluia!
