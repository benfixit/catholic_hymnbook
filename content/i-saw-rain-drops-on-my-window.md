1. I saw raindrops on my window,
Joy is like the rain,
Laughter runs across my pane,
Slips away and comes again,
Joy is like the rain.

2. I saw clouds upon a mountain,
Joy is like a cloud,
Sometimes silver, sometimes gray,
Always sun not far away,
Joy is like a cloud.

3. I saw Christ in rain and thunder,
Joy is tried by storm,
Christ asleep within my boat,
Whipped by wind, yet still afloat,
Joy is tried by storm.

4. I saw raindrops on my river,
Joy is like the rain,
Bit by bit the river grows,
Till all at once it overflows,
Joy is like the rain.
