title: O Word of God Incarnate

---

1. O Word of God incarnate,
O Wisdom from on high,
O Truth unchanged, unchanging,
O Light of our dark sky:
We praise you for the radiance
That from the hallowed page,
A lantern to our footsteps,
Shines on from age to age.

2. The Church from you, dear Savior,
Received this gift divine;
And still that light is lifted
On all the earth to shine.
It is the chart and compass
That, all life's voyage through,
Amid the rocks and quicksands
Still guides, O Christ, to you.

3. O make your Church, dear Savior,
A lamp of purest gold
To bear before the nations
Your true light, as of old;
O teach your wand'ring pilgrims
By this our path to trace,
Till, clouds and storms thus ended,
We see you face to face.
