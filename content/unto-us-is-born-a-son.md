category: entrance

1. Unto us is born a Son,
King of choirs supernal:
See on earth His life begun,
Of lords the Lord eternal.

2. Christ, from heav'n descending low,
Comes on earth a stranger;
Ox and ass their owner know
Be cradled in a manger.

3. This did Herod sore affray,
And grievously bewilder,
So he gave the word to slay,
And slew the little children.

4. Of His love and mercy mild
This the Christmas story:
And O that Mary's gentle Child
Might lead us up to glory!

5. O and A and A and O,
Cum cantibus in choro,
Let the merry organ go,
Benedicamus Domino.
