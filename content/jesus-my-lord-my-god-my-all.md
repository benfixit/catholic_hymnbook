_Chorus:_
_Sweet sacrament, we thee adore!_
_O make us love thee more and more,_
_O make us love thee more and more._

1. Jesus, my Lord, my God, my all!
How can I love thee as I ought?
And how revere this wondrous gift,
So far surpassing hope and thought?

2. Had I but Mary's sinless heart,
To love thee with, my dearest King;
O with what bursts of fervent praise
Thy goodness, Jesus, would I sing!

3. Thy body, soul, and Godhead, all,
O mystery of love divine!
I cannot compass all I have,
For all thou hast and art are mine!

4. Sound, sound his praises higher still,
And come, ye Angels, to our aid;
'Tis God, 'tis God, the very God,
Whose pow'r both man and angels made.
