title: Said Judas to Mary
---

1. Said Judas to Mary, "Now what will you do
With your ointment so rich and rare?"
"I'll pour it all over the feet of the Lord,
I'll wipe it away with my hair", she said,
I'll wipe it away with my hair.

2. "Oh Mary, O Mary, O think of the poor.
This ointment, it could have been sold;
And think of the blanket and think of the bread
You could buy with the silver and gold", he said,
You could buy with silver and gold.

3. Tomorrow, tomorrow, I'll think of the poor;
"Tomorrow", she said, "not  today"
"For dearer than all of the poor in the world
Is my love who is going away," she said,
"My love who is going away."

4. Said Jesus to Mary, "Your love is so deep
Today, you may do as you will.
Tomorrow, you say, I am going away,
But my body I leave with you still," he said,
"My body I leave with you still."

5. "The poor of the world is my body," he said,
To the end of the world they shall be.
The bread and the blanket you give to the poor
You'll know you have given to me, he said,
"You'll know you have given to me."

6. "My body will hang from the cross of the world
Tomorrow," he said, "and today,
And Martha and Mary will find me again
"and wash all the sorrow away," he said,
"And wash all the sorrow away."
