_Chorus:_
_Lord, open my lips_
_and my mouth shall declare Your praise_

1. The heavens proclaim the glory of God,
and the firmament shows forth the work of His hands
Day unto day takes up the story,
And night unto night makes known the message.

2. No speech, no word, no voice is heard,
Yet their span goes forth through all the earth.
Their words to the utmost bounds of the world.

3. There He has placed the tent for the sun;
It comes forth like a bride-groom coming from his tent
Rejoices like a champion to run its course.

4. At the end of the sky is the rising of the sun;
To the furthest end of the sky is its course;
There is nothing concealed from its burning heat.
