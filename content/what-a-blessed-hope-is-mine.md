title: What A Blessed Hope Is Mine
---

_Chorus:_
_He will my soul defend_
_He my unchanging friend_
_He will keep me to the end_
_All glory be to Jesus /2ce_

1. What a blessed hope is mine
Through the love of Jesus
I am heir of the Divine
Through the love of Jesus.

2. For the blessed hope of Christ
I lay strife of this world
For our salvation dear Christ
Did come down to us from the Lord.
