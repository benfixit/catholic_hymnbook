title: I Believe God Lay Sleeping in the Tomb

---

_Chorus:_
_I believe God lay sleeping in the tomb,_
_Waiting until the day should break._
_I believe my Father has care of me,_
_And someday,_
_He'll say; "My child awake."_

1. I believe man was born to die,
Over and over again,
I believe that man Was meant to cry,
"Amen, my Lord, Amen."

2. I believe that the stars are mine,
Love lifts the stars form the night,
I believe there's always sun to shine,
Though sometimes it's hidden from sight.

3. I believe man must die alone,
Tossed like a wave on the sea,
Yet I believe that man must have a home,
God holds a mansion for me.

4. I believe man was born for joy,
Some men must find it in pain,
Some river run through cave beneath the ground,
Sometimes there's sun in the rain.
