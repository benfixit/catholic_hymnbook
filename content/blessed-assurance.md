title: Blessed Assurance

1. Blessed assurance, Jesus is mine;
Oh, what a foretaste of glory divine.
Heir of salvation, purchase of God;
Born of His Spirit, washed in His blood.

_Chorus:_
_This is my story, this is my song,_
_Praising my Savior all the day long._
_This is my story, this is my song,_
_Praising my Savior all the day long._

2. Perfect submission, perfect delight
Visions of rapture now burst on my sight.
Angels descending, bring from above
Echoes of mercy, whispers of love.

3. Perfect submission, all is at rest,
I in my Savior I'm happy and blest,
Watching and waiting, looking above,
Filled with His goodness, lost in His love.
