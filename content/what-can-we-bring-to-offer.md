_Chorus:_
_Father, all that we have_
_Father, comes from Your hands_
_So, we offer You Jesus_
_As our Holy Gift, O Lord, O God_
_As our Holy Gift._

1. What can we we bring to offer
As our gift to You, O Lord, O God
As our gift to You?
You are full of kindness
For Your sinful sons, O Lord, O God
For Your sinful sons.

2. Take them, all of our labor
Suffering and pain, O Lord O God
Suffering and pain.
Take them, beauty and gladness
Heart and mind and will, O Lord, O God
Heart and mind and will.

3. Bread and wine will be given
Humble food and drink, O Lord, O God
Humble food and drink.
Symbols of human labours
Symbols of ourselves, O Lord O God
Symbols of ourselves.

4. But our Jesus will change them
To His risen self, O Lord, O God
To His risen self.
He will share with His brothers
Life and truth and love, O Lord, O God
Life and truth and love.
