title: On Jordan's Bank

---

1. On Jordan's bank the Baptist's cry
Announces that the Lord is nigh;
Awake and hearken, for he brings
Glad tidings of the King of kings.

2. Then cleansed be ev'ry heart from sin;
Make straight the way for God within,
And let each heart prepare a home
Where such a mighty guest may come.

3. For thou art our salvation, Lord,
Our refuge and our great reward;
Without thy grace we waste away
Like flow'rs that wither and decay

4. To heal the sick, stretch out thine hand,
And bid the fallen sinner stand;
Shine forth and let thy light restore
Earth's own true loveliness once more.

5. All praise, eternal Son, to thee,
Whose advent doth thy people free;
Whom with the Father we adore,
And Holy Ghost forevermore.
