_Chorus:_
_Alleluia, alleluia!_
_Alleluia is our song of joy!_
_Sing the song we will sing forever:_
_Alleluia, alleluia!_

1. This is the day that the Lord has made;
Let us be glad and rejoice in it!
Let us be glad and rejoice!
This is the day that the Lord has made.

2. This is the day when the Lord arose;
Let us be glad and rejoice in it!
Let us be glad and rejoice!
This is the day when the Lord arose.

3. This is the day when we rise with Him;
Let us be glad and rejoice in it!
Let us be glad and rejoice!
This is the day when we rise with Him!

4. This is the day all the world is new;
Let us be glad and rejoice in it!
Let us be glad and rejoice!
This is the day all the world is new!
