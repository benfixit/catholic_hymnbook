title: When I Look At the Work of Your Hands

---

_Chorus:_
_When I look at the work of Your hands_
_Wonderful, wonderful is Your handiwork._

1. Lord, our God, glorious is Your name
Blazoned through all the earth.
Even the infants Your power proclaim
And babes at new birth.

2. When I look at the heavens above
The moon and the stars You have set
What is man that You show him love
And never forget?

3. Your dominion You let him share
Of creatures of field and stall.
Fish of the sea and birds of the air
For him You made all.
