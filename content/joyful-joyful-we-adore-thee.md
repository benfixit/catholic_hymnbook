1. Joyful, joyful we adore thee,
God of glory, Lord of love;
Hearts unfold like flow'rs before thee,
Op'ning to the sun above.
Melt the clouds of sin and sadness;
Drie the dark of doubt away;
Giver of immortal gladness,
Fill us with the light of day!

2. All thy works with joy surround thee,
Earth and heav'n reflect thy rays,
Stars and angels sing around thee,
Center of unbroken praise;
Field and forest, vale and mountain,
Flow'ry meadow, flashing sea,
Chanting bird and flowing fountain,
Call us to rejoice in thee.

3. Thou art giving and forgiving,
Ever blessing, ever blest,
Well-spring of the joy of living,
Ocean-depth of happy rest!
Thou art Father, Christ our brother,
All who live in love are thine;
Teach us how to love each other,
Lift us to the Joy Divine.

4. Mortals, join the mighty chorus
Which the morning stars began;
Father love is reigning o'er us,
Brother love binds man to man.
Ever singing, march we onward,
Victors in the mids of strife;
Joyful music leads us sunward
In the triumph song of life.
