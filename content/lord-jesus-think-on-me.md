1. Lord Jesus, think on me,
And purge away my sin;
From earth-born passions set me free,
And make me pure within.

2. Lord Jesus, think on me,
With care and woe oppresed;
Let me thy loving servant be,
And taste thy promised rest.

3. Lord Jesus, think on me,
Amid the battle's strife;
In all my pain and misery
Be thou my health and life.

4. Lord Jesus, think on me,
Nor let me go astray;
Through darkness and perplexity
Point thou the heav'nly way.

5. Lord Jesus, think on me,
That, when the flood is past,
I may th'eternal brightness see,
And share thy joy at last.

6. Lord Jesus, think on me,
That I may sing above
To Father, Spirit, and to thee
The strains of praise and love.
