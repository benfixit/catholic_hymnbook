title: The Sun Is Shining Brightly

_Chorus:_
_O Mary, dear Mother,_
_We sing a hymn to thee;_
_Thou art the Queen of heaven,_
_Thou too the Queen shall be,_
_O rule us and guide us_
_Unto eternity._

1. This sun is shining brightly,
The trees are clothed with green,
The beauteous bloom of flowers
On ev'ry side is seen;
The fields are gold and em'rald,
And all the world is gay;
For 'tis the month of Mary,
The lovely month of May.

2. There's music in the heavens,
For birds are singing there,
And nature's songs and praises
Are sounding through the air;
And we with hearts o'erflowing
With joy will sing today;
For 'tis the month of Mary,
The lovely month of May.

3. And when night closes o'er us,
And twinkling stars appear;
The chaste moon calmly reigneth,
In skies so bright and clear.
Oh! how that sight reminds us
Of heaven far away,
Where reigns, o'er saints and angels,
Our lovely Queen of May.
