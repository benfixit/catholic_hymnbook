title: Hail This Joyful Day's Return

---

1. Hail, this joyful day's return;
Hail, the pentecostal morn.
Morn when our ascended head,
On his Church his Spirit shed.
Like the golden tongues of flame,
On the twelve the Spirit came ;
Tongues, that earth may hear their call;
Fire, that love may burn in all.

2. Hear the speech before unknown.
Trembling crowds the wonder own;
What though hardened some abide.
And the holy work deride?
Mystic hour, when Easter's sun.
Seven times seven its course hath run;
Church of Christ from Debt made free,
Hail thy day of jubilee.

3. Lord, to thee thy people bend,
Unto us thy Spirit send;
Blessings of this sacred day
Grant us, dearest Lord, we pray.
Thou who didst our fathers guide.
With their children still abide;
Grant us pardon, grant us peace,
Till our earthly wanderings cease.
