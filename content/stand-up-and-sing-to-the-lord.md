title: Stand Up and Sing to the Lord
---

_Chorus:_
_Stand up and sing to the Lord,_
_We're gathered to worship._
_Lift up your heart and be not afraid._
_We've come together to share His love._
_Stand up and sing to the Lord._

1. Praise the Lord from the heavens,
Praise Him in the heights;
Praise Him all you his angels,
Praise Him all you his hosts;
Praise Him sun and moon;
Praise Him all you shining stars.

2. Praise him you highest heavens
And you waters above the heavens.
Let them praise the name of the Lord
For he commanded and they were created.
He established them for ever and ever;
He gave them a duty which shall not pass away.

3. Praise the Lord from the earth;
You sea monsters and all depths;
Fire and hail, snow and mist,
Storm winds that fulfil His word;
You mountains and all you hills,
You fruit trees and all you cedars;
You wild beasts and all tame animals,
You creeping things and you winged fowls.
