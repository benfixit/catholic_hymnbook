_Chorus:_
_Salve, Salve,_
_Salve, Regina._

1. Hail, holy Queen enthroned above, O Maria,
Hail, Mother of mercy and of love, O Maria.
Triumph, all ye Cherubim,
Sing with us, ye Seraphim,
Heav'n and earth resound the hymn.

2. The cause of joy to all below, O Maria,
The spring through which all graces flow, O Maria.
Angels, all your praises bring,
Earth and heaven, with us sing,
All creation echoing.

3. O gentle, loving, holy one, O Maria,
The God of light became your Son, O Maria.
Triumph, all ye Cherubim,
Sing with us, ye Seraphim,
Heav'n and earth resound the hymn.
