_Chorus:_
_Triumph, all ye Cherubim,_
_Sing with us, ye Seraphim,_
_Heav'n and earth resound the hymn:_
_Salve, Salve,_
_Salve, Regina._

1. Hail, holy Queen enthroned above,
O Maria,
Hail, Mother of mercy and of love,
O Maria.

2. The cause of joy to all below,
O Maria,
The spring through which all graces flow,
O Maria.

3. O gentle, loving, holy one,
O Maria,
The God of light became your Son,
O Maria.
