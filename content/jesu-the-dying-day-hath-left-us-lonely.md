title: Jesu! The Dying Day Hath Left Us Lonely
---

1. Jesu! the dying day hath left us lonely;
All fadeth from us; thou remainest only;
Earth's light goes out, but thou, true light, are near us,
And thou wilt hear us.

2. Bring home the feet that far from thee have wandered,
The minds that all but thee all day have pondered;
We yield them evermore, awake or sleeping,
To thy safekeeping.

3. O let our souls keep day, through night be round us!
So shall the sons of darkness not confound us,
But blameless rest delight thy gaze paternal,
Untired Eternal!

4. White Dove of peace, great God of consolation,
Brood o'er the souls that moan in tribulation,
And with the whisper of serene tomorrows
Soothe all their sorrows.

5. Mother of holy hope, all-blessed Mary,
Whose high-throned mother-love can never vary,
This night, and at out death's deep nightfall aid us,
With him who made us.
