title: Go Tell It on the Mountain

---

_Refrain:_
_Go, tell it on the mountain,_
_Over the hills and everywhere._
_Go tell it on the mountain,_
_Our Jesus Christ is born._

1. When I was a learner,
I sought both night and day;
I asked the Lord to help me,
And He showed me the way.

2. While shepherds kept their watching
O'er silent flocks by night,
Behold throughout the heavens,
There shone a holy light.

3. Lo, when they had seen it,
They all bowed down and prayed;
They travelled on together
To where the babe was laid.
