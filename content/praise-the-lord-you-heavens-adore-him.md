1. Praise the Lord! you heav'ns adore Him;
Praise him angels, in the height;
Sun and moon, rejoice before Him;
Praise Him, all you stars of light.
Praise the Lord! for He has spoken;
Worlds His mighty voice obeyed;
Laws which never shall be broken
For their guidance He has made.

2. Praise the Lord! for He is glorious;
Never shall His promise fail;
God has made His saints victorious;
Sin and death shall not prevail.
Praise the God of our salvation!
Hosts on high His pow'r proclaim;
Heav'n, and earth, and all creation,
Praise and magnify His name.
