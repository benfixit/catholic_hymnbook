title: Ye Who Own the Faith of Jesus

---

_Chorus:_
_Hail Mary, full of grace._

1. Ye who own the faith of Jesus,
Sing the wonders that were done
When the love of God the Father
O'er our sin the vict'ry won,
When he made the Virgin Mary
Mother of his only Son.

2. Blessed were the chosen people
Out of whom the Lord did come,
Blessed was the land of promise
Fashioned for his earthly home;
But more blessed far the Mother
She who bare him in her womb.

3. Wherefore let all faithful people
Tell the honor of her name,
Let the Church, in her forshadowed,
Part in her thanksgiving claim;
What Christ's Mother sang in gladness
Let Christ's people sing the same.
