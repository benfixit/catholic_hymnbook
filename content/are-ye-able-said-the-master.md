title: Are Ye Able? Said the Master

---

1. "Are ye able," said the Master
"To be crucified with Me?"
"Yea," the conquering christians answered;
"To the death we follow Thee."

_Chorus:_
_Lord, we are able, our spirits are Thine,_
_Remold them, make us like Thee, divine:_
_Thy guiding radiance above us shall be,_
_A beacon to God, to love and loyalty._

2. O heart! Thou joy of saints on high!
Thou hope of sinners here.
Attracted by those loving words,
To Thee I lift my prayer.

3. Wash Thou my wounds in that dear blood
Which forth from Thee doth flow;
New grace, new hope inspire, a new
And better heart bestow.
