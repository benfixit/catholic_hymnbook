_Chorus:_
_Sing Alleluia, the Lord is risen_
_He is risen indeed, Alleluia!_

1. My Lord, He died for a kingdom,
To redeem the hearts of men,
Now my people don't you weep,
He has risen from His sleep,
He lives again, Alleluia!

2. My Lord came forth like the morning
With the splendour of the sun
Came triumphant from the womb
From the darkness of the tomb
The victory won, Alleluia!

3. My Lord united our mountains,
With the everlasting hills,
Now the seasons and the sea,
Sing His song of victory
Rock and rills, Alleluia!

4. My Lord renewal all creation,
That had waited late and long,
Now we all with one accord,
live and love the Risen Lord
This is our song, Alleluia!
