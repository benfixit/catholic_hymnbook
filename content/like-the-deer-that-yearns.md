title: Like the Deer That Yearns

---

_Chorus:_
_I shall go to the house of God_
_with songs of joy._

1. Like the deer that yearns
For running streams,
So my soul is yearning
For You, my God.

2. My soul is thirsting for God,
The God of my life;
When can I enter and see
The face of God?

3. My tears have become my bread
By night and by day.
As I hear it said all day long:
"Where is your God?"

4. Why are you cast down my soul,
Why groan within me?
Hope in God, I will praise Him still
My Saviour and my God.

5. Praise the Father, the Son and Holy Spirit,
Both now and forever,
The God who is, who was and who will be,
World without end.
