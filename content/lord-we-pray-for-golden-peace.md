title: Lord We Pray for Golden Peace

---

_Chorus:_
_Banish fear and ignorance,_
_Hunger thirst and pain_
_Banish hate and poverty;_
_Let no one live in vain,_
_Let no one live in vain._

1. Lord we pray for golden peace,
Peace all over the land,
May all men dwell in liberty,
Walking hand in hand.

2. Keep all men forever one,
One in love and grace,
Wipe away all war and strife,
Give freedom to each race.

3. Let Your justice reign supreme,
And righteousness be done,
Let goodness rule the hearts of men,
And evil be overcome,
