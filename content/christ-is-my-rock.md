_Refrain:_
_Christ is my Rock, my Refuge, my Stronghold,_
_Firm as the tree's root that clutches the land._
_He who has faith builds without worry,_
_Not like the man who builds upon sand._
_I set my house on a solid foundation:_
_Christ is my Rock, the root of my soul's recreation._

1. I know a man who loved to live free,
He pitched his tent by the side of the sea.
It stood near the surf and was washed by the spray,
Till one day a wave came and washed it away.

2. I know a man who loved to live high,
He build his castle near up to the sky.
Through summer and spring, it stood pretty well,
When winter winds whistled, it toppled and fell.

3. I know a man, a cool one to know,
He built his house out of ice and of snow.
In chill isolation his night work was done,
But it melted away with the warm morning sun.

4. I know a man who build out of straw,
The flimsiest fellow that I ever saw.
One day a spark set it to flame
And nothing was left to remember his name.
