1. Nearer, my God, to Thee,
Nearer to Thee!
E'en though it be a cross
That raiseth me,
Still all my song shall be,
Nearer, my God, to Thee.
Nearer, my God, to Thee,
Nearer to Thee!

2. Deep in thy Sacred Heart,
Let me abide.
Thou that has bled for me,
Sorrowed and died.
Sweet shall me weeping be,
Grief surely leading me,
Nearer, my God, to Thee,
Nearer to Thee!

3. Friends may depart from me,
Night may come down,
Clouds of adversity
darken and frown:
Still through my tears I'll see
Hope gently leading me,
Nearer, my God, to Thee,
Nearer to Thee!
