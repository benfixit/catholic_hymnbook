1. Glorious things of thee are spoken,
Zion, city of our God;
He whose word cannot be broken
Formed thee for his own abode;
On the Rock of Ages founded,
What can shake thy sure repose?
With salvation's walls surrounded,
Thou may'st smile at all thy foes.

2. See! The streams of living waters,
Springing from eternal love,
Well supply thy sons and daughters
And all fear of want remove,
Who can faint, when such a river,
Ever will their trust assuage?
Grace which like the Lord, the giver,
Never fails from age to age.

3. Round each habitation hov'ring,
See the cloud and fire appear
For a glory and a cov'ring
Showing that the Lord is near.
Thus deriving from their banner,
Light by night, and shade by day,
Safe they feed upon the manna
Which he gives them when they pray.

4. Blest in habitants of Zion,
Washed in the Redeemer's blood!
Jesus, whom their souls rely on,
Makes them kings and priests to God,
'Tis his love his people raises
Over self to reign as kings:
And as priests, his solemn praises
Each for thankful off'ring brings.
