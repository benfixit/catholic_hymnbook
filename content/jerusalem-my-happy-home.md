title: Jerusalem, My Happy Home

---

1. Jerusalem, my happy home,
When shall I come to thee?
When shall my sorrows have an end?
Thy joys, when shall I see?

2. O happy harbor of the saints,
O sweet and pleasant soil!
In you no sorrow may be found,
No grief, no care, no toil.

3. Your gardens and your gallant walks
Continually are green;
Thre grow much sweet and pleasant flow'rs
As nowhere else are seen.

4. There, trees forevermore bear fruit
And evermore do spring,
There, evermore the angels sit
And evermore do sing.

5. Jerusalem, Jerusalem,
God grant that I may see
Your endless joy, and of the same
Partaker ever be!
