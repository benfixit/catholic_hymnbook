title: We Praise Thee O God

---

_Chorus:_
_Alleluia, Thine the glory_
_Alleluia, Amen_
_Alleluia, Thine the glory_
_Revive us again._

1. We praise Thee, O God
For the Son of Thy love
For Jesus who died
And is now gone above.

2. We praise Thee, O God
For Thy Spirit of light
Who has shown us our Savior
And scattered our night.

3. All glory and praise
To the Lamb that was slain
And has cleansed every stain
From all His children.

4. Revive us again
Fill each soul with Thy love
May each soul be rekindled
With fire from above.
