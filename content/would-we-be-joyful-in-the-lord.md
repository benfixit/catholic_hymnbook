_Chorus:_
_There is pardon, peace and power_
_And purity and paradise_
_With all of these, in Christ for me_
_Let joyful songs of praise to Him arise._

1. Would we be joyful in the Lord
Then count the riches over
Revealed to faith with His word
And the boundless store.

2. For every sin by grace divine
A pardon free bestowed
And with the pardon peace is mine
The peace in Jesus' blood.

3. Of grace to break the power of sin
He gives a full supply
The Holy Ghost the heart within
From sin do purify.

4. The power to win a soul to God
The spirit to impart
And He, the gift of Christ our Lord
Dwells now in all our hearts.

5. These blessings we by faith receive
By simple child-like trust
In Christ 'tis God's delight to give
He promised and he must.
