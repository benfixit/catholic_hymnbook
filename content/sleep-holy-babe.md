1. Sleep! Holy Babe!
Upon Thy mother's breast;
Great Lord of earth and sea and sky,
How sweet it is to see Thee lie
In such a place of rest.

2. Sleep! Holy Babe!
Thine angels watch around,
All bending low with folded wings,
Before th'incarnate King of kings,
In reverent awe profound.

3. Sleep! Holy Babe!
While I with Mary gaze
In joy upon that face awhile,
Upon the loving infant smile
Which there divinely plays.

4. Sleep! Holy Babe!
Ah! take Thy brief repose;
Too quickly will Thy slumbers break,
And Thou to lengthened pains awake
That death alone shall close.

5. O Lady blest,
Sweet Virgin hear my cry;
Forgive the wrong that I have done
To thee, in causing Thy dear Son
Upon the Cross to die.
