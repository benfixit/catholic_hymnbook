title: Crown Him with Many Crowns
---

1. Crown him with many crowns,
The Lamb upon His throne.
Hark, how the heavenly anthem drowns
All music but its own;
Awake, my soul, and sing,
Of Him who died for thee,
And hail Him as thy matchless king
Through all eternity.

2. Crown Him the Virgin's Son,
The God incarnate born,
Whose arm those crimson trophies won,
Which now His brow adorn;
Fruit of the mystic rose,
As of that rose the stem,
The root, whence mercy ever flows,
The Babe of Bethlehem.

3. Crown Him the Lord of love;
Behold his hands and side,
Rich wounds yet visible above,
In beauty glorified;
No angels in the sky
Can fully bear that sight,
But downward bends His burning eye
At mysteries so bright.
