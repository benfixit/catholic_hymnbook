_Chorus:_
_Then I will love thee, then I will love thee,_
_then I will love thee daily more and more._

1. O Sacred Heart, what shall I render thee,
For all the gifts thou hast bestowed on me?
O Heart of God, thou seem'st but to implore,
That I should love thee daily more and more.

2. O Heart of Jesus, come and live in me,
That with thy love my heart consumed may be;
O Sacred Heart of Jesus, I implore,
That I may love the daily more and more.

3. O Sacred Heart, be this our life's one aim,
To labor for the glory of thy name;
O dearest Heart, this grace we thee implore,
That all the world may know and love thee more.
