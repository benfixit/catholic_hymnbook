1. Draw near and take the body of the Lord,
And drink with faith the blood for you outpoured;

2. Saved by his body, hallowed by his blood,
With souls refreshed we give our thanks to God.

3. Salvation's giver, Christ, the only Son,
By his dear cross and blood the vict'ry won.

4. With heav'nly bread he makes the hungry whole,
Gives living waters to the thirsting soul.

5. Before thy presence, Lord, all people bow.
In this thy feast of love be with us now.
