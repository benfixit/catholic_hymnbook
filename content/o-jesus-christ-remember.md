title: O Jesus Christ, Remember

---

1. O Jesus Christ, remember,
When thou shalt come again,
Upon the clouds of heaven
With all thy shining train;
When ev'ry eye shall see thee
In Deity revealed,
Who now upon this altar
In silence art concealed.

2. Remember, then, O Savior,
I supplicate of thee,
That here I bowed before thee,
Upon my bended knee;
That here I owned thy presence,
And did not thee deny;
And glorified thy greatness,
Though hid from human eye.

3. Accept, divine Redeemer,
The homage of my praise,
Be thou the light and honor
And glory of my days,
Be thou my consolation
When death is drawing nigh;
Be thou my only treasure,
Through all eternity.
