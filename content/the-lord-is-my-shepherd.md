title: The Lord is My Shepherd (Psalm 23)
---

_Chorus:_
_My shepherd is the Lord,_
_nothing indeed shall I want._

1. The Lord is my shepherd,
There is nothing I shall want.
Fresh and green are the pastures,
Where He gives me repose.
Near restful waters He leads me
To revive my drooping spirit.

2. He guides me along the right path,
He is true to His name.
If I should walk in the valley of darkness,
No evil would I fear.
You are there with Your crook and Your staff:
With these You give me comfort.

3. You have prepared a banquet for me
In the sight of my foes.
My head You have anointed with oil,
My cup is overflowing.

4. Surely goodness and kindness shall follow me
All the days of my life.
In the Lord's own house shall I dwell,
Forever and ever.

5. To the Father and Son give glory,
Give glory to the Spirit.
The God who is, who was, and who will be
For ever and ever
