title: Come, Holy Ghost, Creator Blest

1. Come, Holy Ghost, Creator blest,
And in our hearts take up thy rest;
Come with thy grace and heav'nly aid
To fill the hearts which thou hast made.
To fill the hearts which thou hast made.

2. O Comforter, to thee we cry,
Thou hea'nly gift of God most high,
Thou font of life and fire of love,
And sweet annointing from above.
And sweet annointing from above.

3. Praise be to thee, father and Son,
And Holy Spirit, Three in one;
And may the Son on us bestow
The gifts that from the Spirit flow.
The gifts that from the Spirit flow.
