_Chorus:_
_Dear children, praise His holy name,_
_Adore His presence, fear His word,_
_And oh in all be this thy aim,_
_Still more and more to praise the Lord._

1. Dear children, praise the Lord in all,
Early and late, in mirth and tears.
Lift up thy voice in earnest call,
With mingled love and holy fear.

2. Praise Him for all His mercies given
In flowing streams with lavish hand,
Who made thee that thy soul in heav'n
Might ever in His presence stand.

3. Praise Him who in Baptismal rite
Called thee from sin to life of grace,
Who pour'd on thee His holy light
To fit thee for the heav'nly place.
