title: God Be with You till We Meet Again
---

1. God be with you till we meet again!
By his counsels guide, uphold you;
With his sheep securely fold you;
God be with you till we meet again!

_Chorus:_
_Till we meet! Till we meet!_
_Till we meet at Jesus feet!_
_Till we meet! Till we meet!_
_God be with you till we meet again!_

2. God be with you till we meet again!
'Neath His wings securely hide you;
Daily manna still provide you;
God be with you till we meet again!

3. God be with you till we meet again!
When life's perils thick confound you;
Put His loving arms around you;
God be with you till we meet again!

4. God be with you till we meet again!
Keep love's banner floating o'er you;
Smite death's threat'ning wave before you;
God be with you till we meet again!
