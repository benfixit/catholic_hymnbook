1. Christ is King of earth and heaven!
Let his subjects all proclaim,
In the splendour of His temple,
Honour to His holy name.

2. Christ is King! No soul created
Can refuse to bend the knee,
To the God made man who reigneth
As ‘twas promised, from the tree.

3. Christ is King! Let humble sorrow
For our past neglect atone,
For the lack of faithful service
To the Master whom we own.

4. Christ is King! Let joy and gladness
Greet him; let his courts resound
With the praise of faithful subjects
To his love in honour bound.

5. Christ is king! In health and sickness,
Till we breathe our latest breath,
Till we greet in highest heaven,
Christ the victory over death.
