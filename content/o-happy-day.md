title: O Happy Day
---

_Chorus:_
_Happy day, happy day,_
_When Jesus washed my sins away!_
_He taught me how to watch and pray,_
_And live rejoicing every day;_
_Happy day, happy day,_
_When Jesus washed my sins away!_

1. O happy day that fixed my choice
On Thee, my Savior and my God!
Well may this glowing heart rejoice,
And tell its raptures all abroad.

2. Tis done—the great transaction's done;
I am my Lord's, and He is mine;
He drew me and I followed on,
Charmed to confess the voice divine.

3. Now rest, my long-divided heart,
Fixed on this blissful center, rest;
Nor ever from Thy Lord depart,
With Him of every good possessed..

4. High Heaven that hears the solemn vow,
That vow renewed shall daily hear,
Till in life's latest hour I bow,
And bless, in death, a bond so dear.
