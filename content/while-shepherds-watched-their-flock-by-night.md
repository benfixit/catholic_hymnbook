title: While Shepherds Watched Their Flock By Night
---

1. While shepherds watched their flock by night
All seated on the ground
The angel of the Lord came down
And glory shown around.

2. “Fear not” said he - for mighty dread
Had seized their troubled minds
“Glad tidings of great joy I bring
To you and all mankind.

3. “To you, in David's town, this day
Is born of David's line
The Savior, who is Christ the Lord
And this shall be the sign.

4. “The heavenly Babe you there shall find
To human view displayed
All  meanly wrapped in swathing bands
And in a manger laid”.

5. Thus spoke the Seraph - and forthwith
Appeared a shining thong
Of angels, praising God, who thus
Addressed their joyful song.

6. “All glory be to God on high!
And to the earth be peace!
Good-will henceforth from heaven to men
Begin, and never cease!
