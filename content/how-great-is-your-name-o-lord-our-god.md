_Chorus:_
_How great is your name, O Lord our God_
_Through all the earth!_

1. Your majesty is praised above the heaven,
On the lips of children and babes
You have found praise to foil your enemy,
To silence the foe and the rebel.

2. When I see the heavens, the work of your hands,
The moon and the stars which you arranged,
What is man that you should keep him in mind
Mortal man that you care for him?

3. Yet you have made him little less than a god,
With glory and honour you crowned him,
Gave him power over the works of your hand,
Put all things under his feet.

4. All of them sheep and cattle,
Yes, even the savage beasts,
Birds of the air, and fish
That make their way through the waters.

5. Give glory to the Father Almighty,
To His Son, Jesus Christ, the Lord,
To the Spirit who dwells in our hearts,
Both now and for ever, Amen
